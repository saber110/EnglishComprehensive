He has been tasked to mediate a legal settlement out of more than 180 lawsuits brought by states and others against name-brand opioid makers and drug distributors.</p><p>对于希望扭转阿片类药物过量用药上升趋势的美国人来说，一个好的起点是克利夫兰联邦法官Dan Polster的法庭。他的任务是调解州和其他人针对名牌阿片类药物制造商和药品经销商提起的180多起诉讼中的法律解决方案。</ p><p>Judge Polster has offered this strong counsel to the plaintiffs and defendants: Ending the opioid crisis is too urgent to allow years of litigation over who is to blame. The first step in finding a solution is to reduce the anger over causes. The way forward is to admit a common interest in funding remedies.</p><p> Polster法官向原告和被告提出了这一强有力的建议：结束阿片类药物危机迫在眉睫，无法就多数人的责任进行多年的诉讼。寻找解决方案的第一步是减少对原因的愤怒。前进的方向是承认资助补救措施的共同利益。</ p><p>He has ordered all sides to think through the problem together, “not as a fight to be won or lost,” as he told a group of law students. He has brought in experts on drug use and treatment to advise the litigants in closed-door sessions. And to reduce the temptation to raise the political temperature, he ordered the parties not to speak to the news media.</p>他告诉一群法学院学生，他命令所有各方一起思考这个问题，“不是为了赢得或失败的斗争”。他带来了吸毒和治疗方面的专家，以便在闭门会议上向诉讼当事人提供建议。为了减少提高政治温度的诱惑，他命令各方不要与新闻媒体对话。</ p><p>Courts, like politics or the news media, need not always be arenas solely for adversarial battles. When the United States is losing about 150 people a day to drug overdoses, the judge is wise to avoid a jury trial and set a tone of reconciliation. The opposing views and facts over the responsibility of the drug industry in marketing painkillers would take too long to sort out in court appeals, would be unpredictable in the outcome, and perhaps yield too little in money years from now.</p><p>法院，如政治或新闻媒体，并不总是仅仅是针对对抗性战斗的竞技场。当美国每天因吸毒过量而失去约150人时，法官明智地避免陪审团审判并确定和解基调。关于药品行业在销售止痛药方面的责任的相反观点和事实将需要很长时间才能在法庭上诉，在结果中难以预测，并且从现在开始可能产生的金钱太少。</ p><p>Judges often push litigants to see the greater good in a brokered settlement. The reason is obvious. “It’s almost never productive to get the other side angry,” Polster said. “They lash out and hurt you and themselves.” Or as President Obama once put it, “We can’t move forward if all we do is tear each other down.”</p><p>法官经常敦促诉讼当事人在经纪人解决方案中看到更大的利益。原因很明显。 “让对方生气，几乎从来都没有成效，”波尔斯特说。 “他们抨击并伤害你和他们自己。”或正如奥巴马总统曾经说过的那样，“如果我们所做的只是相互撕裂，我们就无法前进。”</ p><p>The judge says he felt compelled to force a large-scale mediation effort because, as he put it, other branches of government have “punted” on solving the opioid crisis. The additional money needed by governments to prevent and treat opioid addiction is estimated to be in the billions of dollars.</p><p>法官说，他觉得有必要强制进行大规模的调解工作，因为正如他所说的那样，其他政府部门在解决阿片类药物危机方面“受到了抨击”。政府预防和治疗阿片类药物成瘾所需的额外资金估计为数十亿美元。</ p><p>The outcome of the judge’s tactics may not be known until the end of 2018. But one possible result of the talks so far was the announcement by Purdue Pharma, maker of OxyContin, that it would no longer market the drug to doctors. The company also said it would work closely with the judge’s purpose. His anger management may be working.</p><p>法官的策略结果可能要到2018年底才知道。但到目前为止谈判的一个可能结果是，OxyContin的制造商Purdue Pharma宣布它将不再向医生推销这种药物。该公司还表示将与法官的目的密切合作。他的愤怒管理可能正在发挥作用。</ p>','2018-10-28 15:18:26','N'),(214,'https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2018/0306/Did-North-Korea-just-make-a-try-for-trust','Did North Korea just make a try for trust?','<p> By the numbers alone, the prospects of peace on the Korean Peninsula can look bleak to the rest of the world:</p><p>仅就这些数字而言，朝鲜半岛的和平前景对世界其他地区来说可能是黯淡的：</ p><p>For 27 years, five American presidents have tried to denuclearize North Korea. Three times the regime appeared to have suspended its nuclear program. Yet it may now have more than 30 atomic warheads.

Such a proposal to eliminate the North’s nuclear weapons is quite a dramatic reversal. Last year the regime claimed the bombs were a “treasured sword of justice.”</p>也许为了重建信任，朝鲜3月6日宣布，如果“其政权的安全得到保障，对朝鲜的军事威胁被取消”，韩国愿意考虑放弃其战略武器，韩国发言人表示。这种消除北韩核武器的建议是一个相当戏剧性的逆转。去年，该政权宣称炸弹是“珍贵的正义之剑”。</ p><p>Yet with its credibility gone, the North needs a dramatic U-turn to end sanctions.

And China certainly shows new worries about a possible flood of refugees across its border.</p><p>由于严酷的冬季对朝鲜造成了影响，金朝可能会担心政权更改会从内部而不是从外部转变。中国肯定会对可能发生的边境洪水泛滥表现出新的担忧。</ p><p>A model for hope is the 2015 deal with Iran. Long before Iran agreed to give up its nuclear program in negotiations, it first had to earn the trust of Western countries, at least on the nuclear issue. International isolation had pushed the regime to fear its own people more than external foes. The first step for Iran was to stop being disingenuous about its nuclear ambitions. Through concrete steps, such as international inspections, it regained trust.</p><p>希望的典范是2015年与伊朗的交易。早在伊朗同意在谈判中放弃核计划之前，它首先必须赢得西方国家的信任，至少在核问题上如此。国际孤立使得政权更加害怕自己的人民而不是外部敌人。伊朗的第一步是停止对其核野心不诚实。通过国际检查等具体步骤，它重新获得了信任。</ p><p>North Korea may be at such a point. Yet testing its motives will require careful diplomacy by the US and South Korea. Trust is not easily won. But if the Kim regime can make irreversible concessions on its nuclear program, it will earn trust aplenty.</p>朝鲜可能就是这样一个问题。然而，测试其动机将需要美国和韩国的谨慎外交。信任不容易获胜。但如果金政权能够对其核计划作出不可逆转的让步，它将获得充分的信任。</ p>','2018-10-28 15:18:36','N'),(215,'https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2018/0227/What-a-pause-in-Syria-s-war-can-mean','What a pause in Syria’s war can mean','<p>Unlike in Las Vegas, what happens in Syria refuses to stay in Syria.

They also reflect the steady advance of the international order established in 1945 after World War II, such as the obligation of nations to uphold rules of conduct in a conflict.

In the United States, for example, the number of people seeking to rent has been at record highs for five years. Yet construction of new units is about a third below demand. The result: Of the 44 million Americans who rent, about half spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing.</p><p>当建筑师被要求从头开始设计一个社区时，很多都是从基本住房短缺的前提出发的。例如，在美国，寻求租房的人数已达到创纪录的五年高位。然而，新单位的建设比需求低约三分之一。结果：在4400万美国人中，有一半人将超过30％的收入用于住房。</ p><p>The easy solution is more high-rises, right?</p><p>简单的解决方案是更高层次的，对吗？</ p><p>Not necessarily, according to a breed of architects who start from a different premise.

People buy into a community as much as they do a set of rooms. Why not start with their social needs first?</p><p>不一定，根据从不同前提开始的一群建筑师的说法。他们认为住房不仅仅是住房。它们始于个人使用住宅扩大其可能性并参与小社会的自然愿望。人们和一组房间一样买入社区。为什么不先从他们的社会需求开始呢？</ p><p>This type of architect is still rare. But an early pioneer, Balkrishna Doshi of India, was honored last week with the Pritzker Prize, which is the “Nobel” of architecture. Mr. Doshi is known for designing low-cost housing in India that, as he puts it, empowers the “have-nots” to live well in homes made with inexpensive building materials and designed to create deep connections in shared spaces.</p><p>这种类型的建筑师仍然很少见。但是，早期的先驱者，印度的Balkrishna Doshi，上周获得了普利兹克奖，这是建筑的“诺贝尔奖”。 Doshi先生以在印度设计低成本住房而闻名，正如他所说的那样，它使“穷人”能够在用廉价建筑材料制造的住宅中生活得很好，并且设计用于在共享空间中建立深层连接。</ p ><p>His most noted success is a low-cost housing scheme in the city of Indore for some 80,000 people. It uses prefab materials that allow for easy expansion of living quarters and includes a network of passages and courtyards to forge communal living. The prize committee noted his ability to understand “how cities work” as living organisms.</p><p>他最引人注目的成功是印多尔市的一个低成本住房计划，约有80,000人。它使用预制材料，可以轻松扩展生活区，并包括一个通道和庭院网络，以建立共同生活。奖项委员会注意到他有能力理解“城市如何运作”作为生物体。</ p><p>Or as Doshi once put it, “Planning is not merely physical growth, but also spiritual and cultural, all hinged on availability of resources.” A community of homes must rely on connected lifestyles and the “virtuous skills of the locals.” Homes must allow for self-discovery. And ideally, he says, all aspects of a person’s life, from housing to education to recreation, should be within a half-hour walk.</p><或者正如Doshi曾经说过的那样，“规划不仅仅是物质增长，还包括精神和文化，都取决于资源的可用性。”一个家庭社区必须依靠相互联系的生活方式和“当地人的良好技能”。 “家庭必须允许自我发现。他说，理想情况是，从住房到教育再到娱乐，一个人生活的各个方面都应该在半小时的步行范围内。</ p><p>“The promise of a home is not a limited hope, but the sky becomes the limit,” he told the Guardian newspaper.</p>“对家庭的承诺并不是有限的希望，但天空成了极限，”他告诉“卫报”。</ p><p>In a world marked by rapid communications and transport, Doshi’s work feeds the aspirations for traditional society within new structures. Many of his buildings, while built with modern concrete, also use local crafts, such as mosaics.</p><p>在一个以快速通讯和交通为标志的世界中，Doshi的工作满足了新结构中传统社会的愿望。他的许多建筑都是用现代混凝土建造的，也使用当地的工艺品，如马赛克。</ p><p>An architect, Doshi often says, must turn “refuges into homes, houses into communities, and cities into magnets of opportunities.” Perhaps that can become the motto for designers and developers of new rental communities in the US. </p><p> Doshi经常说，建筑师必须将“避难所变成家庭，房屋，社区和城市的机会。”也许这可能成为美国新租赁社区的设计师和开发者的座右铭。 </ p>','2018-10-28 15:21:02','N'),(223,'https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Readers-Respond/2018/0310/Readers-write-Reactions-to-Armed-in-America-book-review','Readers write: Reactions to \'Armed in America\' book review','<p><i>We received a very robust response to our Jan. 26 review of “<a href=\"http://bit.ly/armedinamerica\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Armed in America</a>,” by Patrick J.

He has been tasked to mediate a legal settlement out of more than 180 lawsuits brought by states and others against name-brand opioid makers and drug distributors.</p><p>对于希望扭转阿片类药物过量用药上升趋势的美国人来说，一个好的起点是克利夫兰联邦法官Dan Polster的法庭。他的任务是调解州和其他人针对名牌阿片类药物制造商和药品经销商提起的180多起诉讼中的法律解决方案。</ p><p>Judge Polster has offered this strong counsel to the plaintiffs and defendants: Ending the opioid crisis is too urgent to allow years of litigation over who is to blame. The first step in finding a solution is to reduce the anger over causes. The way forward is to admit a common interest in funding remedies.</p><p> Polster法官向原告和被告提出了这一强有力的建议：结束阿片类药物危机迫在眉睫，无法就多数人的责任进行多年的诉讼。寻找解决方案的第一步是减少对原因的愤怒。前进的方向是承认资助补救措施的共同利益。</ p><p>He has ordered all sides to think through the problem together, “not as a fight to be won or lost,” as he told a group of law students. He has brought in experts on drug use and treatment to advise the litigants in closed-door sessions. And to reduce the temptation to raise the political temperature, he ordered the parties not to speak to the news media.</p>他告诉一群法学院学生，他命令所有各方一起思考这个问题，“不是为了赢得或失败的斗争”。他带来了吸毒和治疗方面的专家，以便在闭门会议上向诉讼当事人提供建议。为了减少提高政治温度的诱惑，他命令各方不要与新闻媒体对话。</ p><p>Courts, like politics or the news media, need not always be arenas solely for adversarial battles. When the United States is losing about 150 people a day to drug overdoses, the judge is wise to avoid a jury trial and set a tone of reconciliation. The opposing views and facts over the responsibility of the drug industry in marketing painkillers would take too long to sort out in court appeals, would be unpredictable in the outcome, and perhaps yield too little in money years from now.</p><p>法院，如政治或新闻媒体，并不总是仅仅是针对对抗性战斗的竞技场。当美国每天因吸毒过量而失去约150人时，法官明智地避免陪审团审判并确定和解基调。关于药品行业在销售止痛药方面的责任的相反观点和事实将需要很长时间才能在法庭上诉，在结果中难以预测，并且从现在开始可能产生的金钱太少。</ p><p>Judges often push litigants to see the greater good in a brokered settlement. The reason is obvious. “It’s almost never productive to get the other side angry,” Polster said. “They lash out and hurt you and themselves.” Or as President Obama once put it, “We can’t move forward if all we do is tear each other down.”</p><p>法官经常敦促诉讼当事人在经纪人解决方案中看到更大的利益。原因很明显。 “让对方生气，几乎从来都没有成效，”波尔斯特说。 “他们抨击并伤害你和他们自己。”或正如奥巴马总统曾经说过的那样，“如果我们所做的只是相互撕裂，我们就无法前进。”</ p><p>The judge says he felt compelled to force a large-scale mediation effort because, as he put it, other branches of government have “punted” on solving the opioid crisis. The additional money needed by governments to prevent and treat opioid addiction is estimated to be in the billions of dollars.</p><p>法官说，他觉得有必要强制进行大规模的调解工作，因为正如他所说的那样，其他政府部门在解决阿片类药物危机方面“受到了抨击”。政府预防和治疗阿片类药物成瘾所需的额外资金估计为数十亿美元。</ p><p>The outcome of the judge’s tactics may not be known until the end of 2018. But one possible result of the talks so far was the announcement by Purdue Pharma, maker of OxyContin, that it would no longer market the drug to doctors. The company also said it would work closely with the judge’s purpose. His anger management may be working.</p><p>法官的策略结果可能要到2018年底才知道。但到目前为止谈判的一个可能结果是，OxyContin的制造商Purdue Pharma宣布它将不再向医生推销这种药物。该公司还表示将与法官的目的密切合作。他的愤怒管理可能正在发挥作用。</ p>','2018-10-28 15:21:32','N'),(225,'https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2018/0306/Did-North-Korea-just-make-a-try-for-trust','Did North Korea just make a try for trust?','<p> By the numbers alone, the prospects of peace on the Korean Peninsula can look bleak to the rest of the world:</p><p>仅就这些数字而言，朝鲜半岛的和平前景对世界其他地区来说可能是黯淡的：</ p><p>For 27 years, five American presidents have tried to denuclearize North Korea.

Last year the regime claimed the bombs were a “treasured sword of justice.”</p>也许为了重建信任，朝鲜3月6日宣布，如果“其政权的安全得到保障，对朝鲜的军事威胁被取消”，韩国愿意考虑放弃其战略武器，韩国发言人表示。这种消除北韩核武器的建议是一个相当戏剧性的逆转。去年，该政权宣称炸弹是“珍贵的正义之剑”。</ p><p>Yet with its credibility gone, the North needs a dramatic U-turn to end sanctions.

Through concrete steps, such as international inspections, it regained trust.</p><p>希望的典范是2015年与伊朗的交易。早在伊朗同意在谈判中放弃核计划之前，它首先必须赢得西方国家的信任，至少在核问题上如此。国际孤立使得政权更加害怕自己的人民而不是外部敌人。伊朗的第一步是停止对其核野心不诚实。通过国际检查等具体步骤，它重新获得了信任。</ p><p>North Korea may be at such a point.

Last week the dream found some reality. Most of the continent’s 55 countries signed two pacts to reduce tariffs and allow the free movement of people. The agreements not only blow against current global winds of protectionism. If fully implemented, they could create the world’s largest free market – and liberate Africa from many historic dependencies.</p><p>非洲的长期梦想是建立从开罗到开普敦的自由贸易区。上周，梦想找到了一些现实。该大陆55个国家的大多数国家签署了两项减少关税和允许人民自由流动的协定。这些协议不仅打击了当前的全球保护主义风潮。如果全面实施，它们可以创建世界上最大的自由市场 - 并将非洲从许多历史依赖中解放出来。</ p><p>The continent’s 1.2 billion people have much in common, including past colonization and a high reliance on foreign aid. Trade, however, is not widely shared. Only 16 percent of Africa’s exports and imports are with itself. That compares with 70 percent for Europe. If Africa is ever to end its dependence on commodity exports to wealthy nations and unlock its potential to become a manufacturing powerhouse, it must integrate its economies.</p><p>非洲大陆的12亿人有许多共同点，包括过去的殖民统治和对外援的高度依赖。然而，贸易并未广泛分享。非洲只有16％的进出口是自己的。相比之下，欧洲为70％。如果非洲能够结束对富裕国家商品出口的依赖并释放其成为制造业强国的潜力，那么它必须整合其经济。</ p><p>The two pacts are a milestone not only in the potential to boost trade (which is estimated to grow $35 billion by 2020). They are also a step in establishing trust and equality between Africans. When groups of nations open their borders to goods and services, they erode notions of business as a zero-sum transaction. They see the long-term benefits of expanded markets rather than simply the short-term losses and costs of adjustment. A greater flow of goods is seen as a greater good.</p><p>这两个协议不仅是促进贸易的潜在里程碑（预计到2020年将增加350亿美元）。它们也是建立非洲人之间信任和平等的一步。当国家集团开放商品和服务的边界时，他们将商业概念视为零和交易。他们看到扩大市场的长期利益，而不仅仅是短期损失和调整成本。更大的商品流被视为更大的商品。</ p><p>Still, the fear of more intra-Africa trade led 11 countries to put off signing the main pact, the Continental Free Trade Agreement. Two of them, Nigeria and South Africa, worry about competition to their industries or the possibility that some countries will slap “Made in Africa” labels on imports from elsewhere.</p><p>然而，由于担心更多的非洲内部贸易导致11个国家推迟签署主要协议 - 大陆自由贸易协定。他们中的两个，尼日利亚和南非，担心他们的行业会受到竞争，或者有些国家会对来自其他国家的进口产品贴上“非洲制造”的标签。</ p><p>Such concerns can be fairly resolved as negotiations continue to put the agreements into practice. The momentum to see Africa as one market is too strong. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa even suggests creating a single currency as within the European Union.</p><p>随着谈判继续将协议付诸实践，这些担忧可以得到公平解决。将非洲视为一个市场的势头太强劲了。南非总统西里尔·拉马福萨甚至建议在欧盟内部建立单一货币。</ p><p>The continent has a larger middle class than the American population. Its people are digitally connected, especially in financial transactions. And while it still struggles to plant democracies, a continent with a median age of 27 faces strong demands to create greater opportunities. The new pacts could be Africa’s second historic moment of emancipation.</p><p>非洲大陆的中产阶级比美国人口大。它的人是数字连接的，特别是在金融交易中。虽然它仍然在努力种植民主国家，但一个年龄中位数为27岁的大陆面临着创造更多机会的强烈需求。新协议可能是非洲第二个解放的历史性时刻。</ p>','2018-10-28 15:32:10','N'),(266,'https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2018/0328/Why-Facebook-must-like-ethical-investors','Why Facebook must ‘like’ ethical investors','<p>One way to get the attention of a company is to knock $90 billion off its market value.

Among those that fled the stock, many equity firms that specialize in ethical investing, such as BetaShares, dropped the company’s stock from their portfolios.</p><p>获得公司关注的一种方法是从市场价值中剔除900亿美元。这是投资者上周在Facebook发布社交网络允许滥用数百万用户的个人数据后所做的事情。在那些逃离股票的公司中，许多专门从事道德投资的股权公司，如BetaShares，将公司的股票从其投资组合中剔除。</ p><p>As the giant of “surveillance capitalism,” Facebook had met its match with another giant force: social capitalism.</p><p>作为“监视资本主义”的巨人，Facebook已经遇到了与另一个巨大力量：社会资本主义的匹配。</ p><p>Of course, Facebook is also under scrutiny on other fronts for its breaches of privacy. From Congress to the European Union to the Federal Trade Commission, Facebook must answer for breaking the trust of its more than 2 billion consumers. And millions of Facebook users have weighed whether to delete or deactivate their accounts.</p><p>当然，Facebook在其他方面也因其侵犯隐私权而受到审查。从国会到欧盟再到联邦贸易委员会，Facebook必须回答破坏其超过20亿消费者的信任。数以百万计的Facebook用户已经权衡了是否要删除或停用他们的帐户。</ p><p>But tougher regulation of big data collectors such as Facebook may be far off. And consumer boycotts can be fleeting. That is not the case with many of today’s investors who put their money where their conscience is. They expect long-term profits based on whether a company is operating under select social and environmental criteria, such as privacy standards, reduced carbon footprint, and gender fairness on corporate boards.</p><p>但对Facebook等大数据收集者进行更严厉的监管可能还有很长的路要走。消费者抵制可能会稍纵即逝。对于今天的许多投资者而言，情况并非如此，他们将资金投入到良心之中。他们期望长期利润取决于公司是否在特定的社会和环境标准下运营，例如隐私标准，减少碳足迹以及公司董事会的性别公平。</ p><p>In fact, meeting such criteria is considered a “sustainable” way to do business. Last week’s market pressure on Facebook from “sustainability funds” probably pushed chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg to speed up plans to simplify privacy controls and better safeguard the governance of personal data. Facebook users will be able to more easily choose not to reveal certain traits, such as a love of cats or dislike of guns, that can mark them for advertisers, foreign hackers, or political campaigns.</p><p>事实上，满足这些标准被认为是一种“可持续”的经营方式。上周来自“可持续发展基金”的Facebook市场压力可能促使首席执行官马克扎克伯格加快了简化隐私控制和更好地保护个人数据治理的计划。 Facebook用户将能够更容易地选择不透露某些特征，例如对猫的喜爱或对枪支的厌恶，这些特征可以标记为广告商，外国黑客或政治活动。</ p><p>Not all investors agree on the criteria for sustainability, often called “environmental, social, and governance,” or ESG. Should a company, for example, be punished for creating a genetically modified crop seed that can prevent famine but might alter natural crops?</p><p>并非所有投资者都同意可持续性标准，通常称为“环境，社会和治理”或ESG。例如，一家公司是否应该因创造转基因作物种子而受到惩罚，这种种子可以预防饥荒，但可能改变天然作物？</ p><p>Still, ethical investing is now a looming presence over companies. And many “impact investors” are beating the market in profits. They are also challenging the idea that companies must be predatory and exploitative to earn money. Facebook may be learning that lesson very fast.</p><p>尽管如此，道德投资现在仍然是公司的迫在眉睫。许多“影响力投资者”正在打击利润市场。他们还质疑企业必须掠夺性和剥削性才能赚钱的想法。 Facebook可能会非常快地学习这一课程。</ p>','2018-10-28 15:32:11','N'),(267,'https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2018/0326/Latin-America-gets-a-scrubbing','Latin America gets a scrubbing','<p>In mid-April, leaders of the Western Hemisphere, including President Trump, are due to meet at a summit with the theme “democratic governance against corruption.”</p><p> 4月中旬，包括特朗普总统在内的西半球领导人将参加以“反腐败民主治理”为主题的峰会。</ p><p>The host nation, Peru, will have much to offer on that topic.</p><p>东道国秘鲁将在这个话题上提供很多东西。</ p><p>Last week the Peruvian president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, resigned over corruption charges.

Last week the dream found some reality. Most of the continent’s 55 countries signed two pacts to reduce tariffs and allow the free movement of people. The agreements not only blow against current global winds of protectionism. If fully implemented, they could create the world’s largest free market – and liberate Africa from many historic dependencies.</p><p>非洲的长期梦想是建立从开罗到开普敦的自由贸易区。上周，梦想找到了一些现实。该大陆55个国家的大多数国家签署了两项减少关税和允许人民自由流动的协定。这些协议不仅打击了当前的全球保护主义风潮。如果全面实施，它们可以创建世界上最大的自由市场 - 并将非洲从许多历史依赖中解放出来。</ p><p>The continent’s 1.2 billion people have much in common, including past colonization and a high reliance on foreign aid. Trade, however, is not widely shared. Only 16 percent of Africa’s exports and imports are with itself. That compares with 70 percent for Europe. If Africa is ever to end its dependence on commodity exports to wealthy nations and unlock its potential to become a manufacturing powerhouse, it must integrate its economies.</p><p>非洲大陆的12亿人有许多共同点，包括过去的殖民统治和对外援的高度依赖。然而，贸易并未广泛分享。非洲只有16％的进出口是自己的。相比之下，欧洲为70％。如果非洲能够结束对富裕国家商品出口的依赖并释放其成为制造业强国的潜力，那么它必须整合其经济。</ p><p>The two pacts are a milestone not only in the potential to boost trade (which is estimated to grow $35 billion by 2020). They are also a step in establishing trust and equality between Africans. When groups of nations open their borders to goods and services, they erode notions of business as a zero-sum transaction. They see the long-term benefits of expanded markets rather than simply the short-term losses and costs of adjustment. A greater flow of goods is seen as a greater good.</p><p>这两个协议不仅是促进贸易的潜在里程碑（预计到2020年将增加350亿美元）。它们也是建立非洲人之间信任和平等的一步。当国家集团开放商品和服务的边界时，他们将商业概念视为零和交易。他们看到扩大市场的长期利益，而不仅仅是短期损失和调整成本。更大的商品流被视为更大的商品。</ p><p>Still, the fear of more intra-Africa trade led 11 countries to put off signing the main pact, the Continental Free Trade Agreement. Two of them, Nigeria and South Africa, worry about competition to their industries or the possibility that some countries will slap “Made in Africa” labels on imports from elsewhere.</p><p>然而，由于担心更多的非洲内部贸易导致11个国家推迟签署主要协议 - 大陆自由贸易协定。他们中的两个，尼日利亚和南非，担心他们的行业会受到竞争，或者有些国家会对来自其他国家的进口产品贴上“非洲制造”的标签。</ p><p>Such concerns can be fairly resolved as negotiations continue to put the agreements into practice. The momentum to see Africa as one market is too strong. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa even suggests creating a single currency as within the European Union.</p><p>随着谈判继续将协议付诸实践，这些担忧可以得到公平解决。将非洲视为一个市场的势头太强劲了。南非总统西里尔·拉马福萨甚至建议在欧盟内部建立单一货币。</ p><p>The continent has a larger middle class than the American population. Its people are digitally connected, especially in financial transactions.

Yet one reason atrocities like those in Syria keep occurring is that many nations reject rights as universal. China and Russia, for example, cite values as relative only to a culture or “civilization.” Hungary asserts that people are entitled to rights only “where they live.” In conflict zones like Syria, rights are often reduced to one ethnicity or one brand of religion.</p><p>人类必须不断重新发现权利等伟大事实。然而，像叙利亚那样的暴行不断发生的一个原因是，许多国家拒绝将权利视为普遍性。例如，中国和俄罗斯认为价值仅相对于文化或“文明”。匈牙利声称人们只有“在他们居住的地方”才有权享有权利。在叙利亚这样的冲突地区，权利通常会减少到一个民族或一个民族。宗教品牌。</ p><p>Others contend the universality of rights is not compatible with the sovereignty of the nation-state. The 1648 treaty known as the Peace of Westphalia led to today’s notion of the nation-state, or a political entity that is independent, sovereign, and entitled to borders. Yet the 1948 declaration, which gained legal force in 1976 and whose anniversary is being celebrated this year, is not really a challenge to the nation-state. </p><p>其他人认为权利的普遍性与民族国家的主权不相容。被称为威斯特伐利亚和平的1648年条约导致了今天的民族国家概念，或者是一个独立，主权和有权获得边界的政治实体。然而，1948年获得法律效力并于今年庆祝其周年纪念日的宣言对民族国家来说并不是真正的挑战。 </ p><p>In fact, as UN Secretary-General António Guterres stated in February, “We must overcome the false dichotomy between human rights and national sovereignty. Human rights and national sovereignty go hand in hand. There is no contradiction.”</p><p>事实上，正如联合国秘书长安东尼奥·古特雷斯二月所说：“我们必须克服人权与国家主权之间的错误二分法。人权与国家主权齐头并进。没有矛盾。“</ p><p>The historical record shows that when a society enforces human rights, it reinforces its sovereignty. “If we had given much greater attention to human rights globally over the past two decades, millions of lives would have been saved,” said Mr. Guterres.</p><p>历史记录表明，当一个社会强制执行人权时，它会加强其主权。古特雷斯先生说：“过去二十年来，如果我们在全球范围内更加关注人权，那么数百万人的生命将得到拯救。”</ p><p>Seventy years on, the declaration serves as a legal obligation by sovereign states to the sovereignty of each individual and his or her basic rights. Chemical warfare, with its mass killing of civilians, is one of the greatest challenges to those rights. Just how world leaders now respond to the atrocity in Syria will be a measure of how much humanity sees the supreme value of each person as a “fact of existing.”</p><p>七十年过去了，宣言是主权国家对每个人的主权及其基本权利的法律义务。化学战与大规模屠杀平民是对这些权利的最大挑战之一。世界各国领导人现在如何应对叙利亚的暴行，将衡量人类将每个人的最高价值视为“存在的事实”的程度。</ p>','2018-10-28 15:36:54','N'),(278,'https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2018/0405/Cybersecurity-may-be-beating-cyber-fear','Cybersecurity may be beating cyber fear','<p>When Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg testifies before Congress on April 10-11, he will try to explain why the social media giant let the personal data of 87 million users be exploited for targeting voters in the 2016 election.

Such rights, which include the right to life for innocent civilians, did not originate from the United Nations.

Yet one reason atrocities like those in Syria keep occurring is that many nations reject rights as universal. China and Russia, for example, cite values as relative only to a culture or “civilization.” Hungary asserts that people are entitled to rights only “where they live.” In conflict zones like Syria, rights are often reduced to one ethnicity or one brand of religion.</p><p>人类必须不断重新发现权利等伟大事实。然而，像叙利亚那样的暴行不断发生的一个原因是，许多国家拒绝将权利视为普遍性。例如，中国和俄罗斯认为价值仅相对于文化或“文明”。匈牙利声称人们只有“在他们居住的地方”才有权享有权利。在叙利亚这样的冲突地区，权利通常会减少到一个民族或一个民族。宗教品牌。</ p><p>Others contend the universality of rights is not compatible with the sovereignty of the nation-state. The 1648 treaty known as the Peace of Westphalia led to today’s notion of the nation-state, or a political entity that is independent, sovereign, and entitled to borders. Yet the 1948 declaration, which gained legal force in 1976 and whose anniversary is being celebrated this year, is not really a challenge to the nation-state. </p><p>其他人认为权利的普遍性与民族国家的主权不相容。被称为威斯特伐利亚和平的1648年条约导致了今天的民族国家概念，或者是一个独立，主权和有权获得边界的政治实体。然而，1948年获得法律效力并于今年庆祝其周年纪念日的宣言对民族国家来说并不是真正的挑战。 </ p><p>In fact, as UN Secretary-General António Guterres stated in February, “We must overcome the false dichotomy between human rights and national sovereignty. Human rights and national sovereignty go hand in hand. There is no contradiction.”</p><p>事实上，正如联合国秘书长安东尼奥·古特雷斯二月所说：“我们必须克服人权与国家主权之间的错误二分法。人权与国家主权齐头并进。没有矛盾。“</ p><p>The historical record shows that when a society enforces human rights, it reinforces its sovereignty. “If we had given much greater attention to human rights globally over the past two decades, millions of lives would have been saved,” said Mr. Guterres.</p><p>历史记录表明，当一个社会强制执行人权时，它会加强其主权。古特雷斯先生说：“过去二十年来，如果我们在全球范围内更加关注人权，那么数百万人的生命将得到拯救。”</ p><p>Seventy years on, the declaration serves as a legal obligation by sovereign states to the sovereignty of each individual and his or her basic rights. Chemical warfare, with its mass killing of civilians, is one of the greatest challenges to those rights.

The foster father, Hec, shuns him at first, but traumatic events throw them together when they are hunted down with trucks and helicopters after the authorities come to the conclusion that Hec has kidnapped Ricky. The few words spoken by Hec in the film are augmented by actor Sam Neill’s exquisitely etched facial expressions. It’s heartwarming when Ricky finds acceptance at last. <b>– Jeanne Marie Peters, Grants Pass, Ore.</b></p><p>在2016年的电影“寻找狂野的人”中，真正感情的纽带在一部令人愉快的，演员合作的电影中滑稽地编织，其中的角色略显（奇妙）奇怪。在这部电影中，一个聪明但不合时宜的13岁男孩瑞奇被一个怪异的社会工作者保拉带到了新西兰山区的一个偏僻的家中。接纳他的夫妇没有孩子。养父，Hec，起初避开了他，但在当局得出Hec绑架Ricky的结论后，当他们被卡车和直升机追捕时，创伤事件将他们扔在了一起。 Hec在电影中所说的几句话是由演员Sam Neill精心刻画的面部表情所增强的。当Ricky终于接受时，这是令人感到温暖的。 <b>  - 位于俄勒冈州Grants Pass的Jeanne Marie Peters。</ b> </ p><p>I’ve been bingeing the NBC show “Frasier.” I never saw it when it was on television.

He was the nation’s first candidate to defeat an incumbent president and achieve a peaceful handover of power from one party to another. Such democratic success stands out in Africa, which still struggles to remove long-ruling leaders who suppress opponents and tinker with constitutions and elections to stay in power.</p><p>尼日利亚对圣战组织的软实力包括在2015年选举布哈里为总统。他是全国第一位击败现任总统并实现和平从一方到另一方的权力移交的候选人。这种民主的成功在非洲非常突出，非洲仍在努力消除长期执政的领导人，这些领导人压制反对者，修补宪法和选举以保持执政。</ p><p>As a former general, Buhari has improved the military’s capabilities against the insurgents.

When applied to nonvegetation, it means “occurring every two years,” like the art exhibition that takes place in Venice, Italy, the Biennale. <i>Biannual</i>, in contrast, means “twice yearly” – a <i>biannual</i> sale happens twice a year.    </p><p> <i> biennial </ i>的定义非常清楚。当应用于非植被时，它意味着“每两年发生一次”，就像在威尼斯，意大利，双年展中进行的艺术展览。相比之下，<i> Biannual </ i>意味着“每年两次” - 一年两次的<i> biannual </ i>销售。 </ p><p>Other <i>bi- </i>words can be confusing. Paul Beatty’s novel “The Sellout” features a club that meets <i>bimonthly</i>. The meetings, Beatty describes, “consisted mostly of the members who showed up every other week arguing with the ones who came every other month about what exactly ‘bimonthly’ means.” The truth is, <i>bimonthly </i>is ambiguous, with no “correct” definition.</p><p>其他<i> bi- </ i>字可能令人困惑。 Paul Beatty的小说“The Sellout”的特色是一个满足<i>双月</ i>的俱乐部。 Beatty描述的这些会议“主要是那些每隔一周出现一次的成员，每隔一个月与那些出现\'双月\'意味着什么的人争论。”事实是，<i>双月</ i>是模棱两可的，没有“正确”的定义。</ p><p>The same goes for <i>biweekly</i>. In American English, this generally indicates “every two weeks,” but in British English it more commonly refers to something that happens twice a week. If you say “The paper comes out biweekly,” it’s not clear whether it appears every Tuesday and Friday or every other Monday.</p><p> <i>双周</ i>也是如此。在美式英语中，这通常表示“每两周一次”，但在英式英语中，它通常指的是每周发生两次的事情。如果你说“论文每两周出版一次”，目前尚不清楚它是出现在每周二，周五还是每隔一个星期一。</ p><p>If you want to be more precise about timing, the Latin prefix <i>semi-</i> might serve. While <i>bi-</i> means “two,” “twice,” or “doubly,” <i>semi-</i> indicates that a given unit of time is halved. So a <i>semiannual</i> sale happens once every half a year – just like a <i>biannual </i>one.

This sounds odd in American English and is becoming less common in Britain as well. Perhaps the least practical <i>semi-</i> word comes from the Victorian Era, when it was occasionally employed to refer to the timing of tides: <i>semimenstrual,</i> <i>mensis</i> being the Latin word for “month.”   </p><p>英国英语有另外一个有用的术语，“每两周一次：”<每两周一次</ i>，两周是14天。这在美国英语中听起来很奇怪，在英国也越来越少见。也许最不实用的<i>半</ i>字来自维多利亚时代，当它偶尔被用来指潮汐时间时：<i>半月经，</ i> <i> mensis </ i>是“月”的拉丁词。</ p><p>Even if you decide to make a firm distinction between <i>bi-</i> and <i>semi-</i>, these words are used so interchangeably that it’s still confusing.

Mr. Comey has been mentioned along with the “comity” of the Senate, of congressional panels, of laws, and even of a White House garden party – “Comity not Comey?” was the headline – last year. It seems to me that this results from word association. “Comey” looks and sounds like comity, so writers move easily from one to the other. We’ll talk more about that next week. This week, let’s look at comity.</p><p>在关于前联邦调查局局长詹姆斯康梅的新闻文章中，“康复”这个词出现频率惊人。科米先生与参议院的“礼让”，国会小组，法律，甚至白宫花园派对一起被提及 - “Comity not Comey？”是标题 - 去年。在我看来，这是由单词关联产生的。 “Comey”看起来和听起来像是礼让，所以作家很容易从一个移动到另一个。我们下周会谈到更多。本周，让我们来看看礼让。</ p><p>In its broadest sense, comity refers to courtesy, to “kindly and considerate behavior towards others,” as the Oxford English Dictionary puts it. A 17th-century etiquette book picked “comity and affability” (ease talking to others; pleasantness) as essential to a good conversation.</p><p>从最广泛的意义上说，礼貌指的是礼貌，即“对他人善意和体贴的行为”，正如“牛津英语词典”所说的那样。一本17世纪的礼仪书选择了“礼让和友善”（轻松与他人交谈;愉快），这对于良好的对话至关重要。</ p><p>Nowadays, though, its use is almost entirely restricted to the political and legal realms. “The comity of nations,” the idea that countries should respect each other’s laws and customs as far as possible, is a guiding principle of international relations. Comity influences relations among US states as well. Legally, it involves reciprocity: You do something for me, and I’ll do the same for you. It means the courts of Massachusetts recognize judgments from Wyoming, and you can drive all over the country on your Wisconsin license.</p><p>如今，它的使用几乎完全局限于政治和法律领域。 “国家的礼让”，即各国应尽可能尊重彼此的法律和习俗，这是国际关系的指导原则。 Comity也影响美国各州之间的关系。从法律上讲，它涉及互惠：你为我做点什么，我会为你做同样的事。这意味着马萨诸塞州的法院承认怀俄明州的判决，你可以在威斯康星州的许可证上开车到全国各地。</ p><p>The US Senate is – or was – strongly associated with ideals of comity. While they are in the chamber, senators employ an almost exaggerated courtesy, referring to each other as “gentlemen” or “gentlewomen” and “esteemed colleagues.” Many of the recent articles about Comey, however, suggest that Senate comity is under threat or already destroyed.    </p><p>美国参议院与礼让的理想密切相关。当他们进入会议室时，参议员们采取了几乎夸张的礼貌，将对方称为“绅士”或“绅士”和“受尊敬的同事”。然而，最近关于科米的许多文章表明，参议院的礼让受到威胁或者已经毁了</ p><p>In terms of the more superficial sense of comity, this is not true. The Senate has strict rules of decorum. Rule 19 of the Senate bans insults, forbidding members from “imput[ing] ... any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator” to others. People who worry about the decline of Senate civility perhaps forget that this rule was enacted in 1902 after one senator physically attacked another for spreading a “willful, malicious, and deliberate lie.” Outwardly, the Senate remains overwhelmingly courteous.    </p><p>就更肤浅的礼让感而言，这不是真的。参议院有严格的礼仪规则。参议院第19条禁止侮辱，禁止成员“向其他人”施加任何行为或动机不值得或不成为参议员“。担心参议院文明衰落的人们可能会忘记，这条规则是在1902年一名参议员实际攻击另一名参与者传播“故意，恶意和蓄意谎言”后制定的。从表面上看，参议院仍然极其礼貌。 </ p><p>But in the more important sense of comity, that of actual respect and reciprocity, things do seem to be going badly. Senators insult each other in interviews and on the campaign trail. Since the 1990s, successive Congresses have struggled to enact laws, partly because partisan scorn puts reciprocity out of the question.  </p><p>但是，在更重要的礼让意义上，实际的尊重和互惠意识，事情似乎确实很糟糕。参议员在采访和竞选过程中互相侮辱。自20世纪90年代以来，历届国会都在努力制定法律，部分原因是党派蔑视使互惠无可置疑。 </ p><p>Affability now sounds like a very old-fashioned virtue. Let’s hope it’s not too late for comity.</p><p>亲和力现在听起来像是一种非常老式的美德。让我们希望礼让还为时不晚。</ p>','2018-10-28 15:49:58','N'),(322,'https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Movies/2018/0427/Avengers-Infinity-War-is-often-like-watching-one-interminable-battle-scene','\'Avengers: Infinity War\' is often like watching one interminable battle scene','<p>\"Avengers: Infinity War\" reportedly cost around $300 million and was 10 years in the making.

The script, by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, adds the requisite doses of off-kilter Marvel humor, but what is mostly missing is an emotional power to match the graphic thrills. One of the reasons \"Black Panther\" worked as well as it did is because its story functioned on both a visceral and an emotional level.</p><p> Anthony和Joe Russo，他们为我们带来了最后两部“美国队长”电影的兄弟，他们采取了行动。这部电影被称为“无限战争”有一个原因 - 看起来好像我们正在观看一个无休止的战斗场景。该脚本，由克里斯托弗·马库斯和斯蒂芬McFeely，增加必要的剂量平衡度欠佳的奇迹幽默，但什么是大多缺少的是一种情感力量相匹配的图形惊险刺激。 “黑豹”的原因之一就是因为它的故事在内心和情感层面都起作用。</ p><p>Some of the sequences are undeniably thrilling but, at about 2-1/2 hours, overkill sets in early. Diehard Marvel fans will no doubt lap all this stuff up – at the packed screening I attended, even the tiniest Marvel minutiae was greeted with whoops – but I was longing for the showdown with Thanos to bring an end to it all.

When applied to nonvegetation, it means “occurring every two years,” like the art exhibition that takes place in Venice, Italy, the Biennale. <i>Biannual</i>, in contrast, means “twice yearly” – a <i>biannual</i> sale happens twice a year.    </p><p> <i> biennial </ i>的定义非常清楚。当应用于非植被时，它意味着“每两年发生一次”，就像在威尼斯，意大利，双年展中进行的艺术展览。相比之下，<i> Biannual </ i>意味着“每年两次” - 一年两次的<i> biannual </ i>销售。 </ p><p>Other <i>bi- </i>words can be confusing. Paul Beatty’s novel “The Sellout” features a club that meets <i>bimonthly</i>.

While <i>bi-</i> means “two,” “twice,” or “doubly,” <i>semi-</i> indicates that a given unit of time is halved.

This sounds odd in American English and is becoming less common in Britain as well. Perhaps the least practical <i>semi-</i> word comes from the Victorian Era, when it was occasionally employed to refer to the timing of tides: <i>semimenstrual,</i> <i>mensis</i> being the Latin word for “month.”   </p><p>英国英语有另外一个有用的术语，“每两周一次：”<每两周一次</ i>，两周是14天。这在美国英语中听起来很奇怪，在英国也越来越少见。也许最不实用的<i>半</ i>字来自维多利亚时代，当它偶尔被用来指潮汐时间时：<i>半月经，</ i> <i> mensis </ i>是“月”的拉丁词。</ p><p>Even if you decide to make a firm distinction between <i>bi-</i> and <i>semi-</i>, these words are used so interchangeably that it’s still confusing.

His verse often seems like an interior monologue on which the reader is casually eavesdropping.</p><p>这个愿景取决于菲利普斯的新诗集“狂野是风”</ b>的核心。他的诗经常像是一个内心独白，读者随便偷听。</ p><p>The title of \"Wild is the Wind\" refers to an old jazz standard, but it also neatly chimes with Phillips’s interest in nature. The double meaning of the title underscores his equal fascination with both culture and the outdoors. His poems casually quote Lucretius or Marcus Aurelius while touching on wind and water, woods and bonfires, coyotes and storms. In the title poem, Phillips recalls a time when he lived “at the forest’s edge – metaphorically, so it can sometimes seem now, though the forest was real, as my life beside it was....”</p><p>“Wild is the Wind”的标题是指一种古老的爵士乐标准，但它也与菲利普斯对大自然的兴趣巧妙地吻合。标题的双重含义凸显了他对文化和户外的同等魅力。他的诗随便引用了Lucretius或Marcus Aurelius，同时触及风和水，树林和篝火，土狼和暴风雨。在标题诗中，菲利普斯回忆起他生活在森林边缘的时代 - 隐喻，现在有时看起来像现在，虽然森林是真实的，因为我的生活就在旁边......“</ p><p>One isn’t quite sure what engages Phillips more – the real woods, or the idea of them.

In “Swimming,” he artfully compares wind-swept trees to a kind of star that a helmsman might steer by, then wistfully asks, “Do people, anymore, even say helmsman?”</p><p>尽管如此，菲利普斯仍然敏锐地关注着什么是短暂的 - 因为那些因为不能持久而变得更加美丽的东西。在“游泳”中，他巧妙地将风吹过的树木与舵手可能引导的那种明星进行比较，然后若有所思地问道：“人们，再说，甚至是舵手？”</ p><p>What results is a poignant moment – the poet using language to preserve a memory, then wondering if language itself, a cherished instrument for passing what’s precious from one age to another, is also vulnerable to time.</p><p>一个令人痛苦的时刻是什么结果 - 诗人用语言来保存记忆，然后想知道语言本身是否是一种珍贵的工具，可以将珍贵的时间从一个时代传递到另一个时代，也很容易受到时间的影响。</ p><p>It’s a problem perhaps only a poet would be anguished by, though another poem, “Brothers in Arms,” shows Phillips coming to terms with the occupational hazards of his vocation: “I’ve always thought gratitude’s the one correct response to having been made, however painfully, to see this life more up close.”          </p><p>这可能是一个问题，或许只有诗人才会感到痛苦，尽管另一首诗“武器兄弟”显示菲利普斯正在接受他职业的职业危害：“我一直认为感恩是一个正确的反应无论如何痛苦地看到这种生活越来越近了。“</ p><p><i>Danny Heitman, a columnist for The Advocate newspaper in Louisiana, is the author of \'A Summer of Birds: John James Audubon at Oakley House.\'</i></p><p> <i> Danny Heitman是路易斯安那州The Advocate报的专栏作家，他是“鸟之夏：奥克利之家的John James Audubon”的作者。</ i> </ p>','2018-10-28 15:50:23','N'),(327,'https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2018/0517/The-soft-power-of-openness-to-other-languages','The soft power of openness to other languages','<p>A country’s attractiveness to the rest of the world can come in many forms, such as cultural exports, foreign aid, high-tech inventions, or its degree of freedom.

If someone says “dog,” you might say “cat.” If you hear “light,” you might think “dark,” or perhaps “joy” or “sunglasses.” </p><p>在心理学和语言学中，<i>单词关联</ i>被定义为回忆或生成一个单词以响应另一个单词。如果有人说“狗”，你可能会说“猫”。如果你听到“光”，你可能会想到“黑暗”，或者说“喜悦”或“太阳镜”。</ p><p>These are semantic associations, based on the meanings of the words. We also make phonological (according to sound) and orthographic (according to spelling) associations. If you are writing an article about former FBI Director James Comey, as we discussed last week, your mind might turn to “comity,” because the words share similarities of sound and spelling. </p><p>这些是基于单词含义的语义关联。我们还制作音韵（根据声音）和正字法（根据拼写）的关联。如果你正在撰写一篇关于前联邦调查局局长詹姆斯·科米的文章，正如我们上周所讨论的那样，你的思想可能转向“礼让”，因为这些词语有着相似的声音和拼写。 </ p><p>Semantic word association might not immediately bring to mind “fun,” but it actually makes a great party game. The first person says a word, and then people take turns coming up with related words, with the final word often being quite far from the original. “Dog,” for example, might lead to “cat,” “claw,” “sharp,” “intelligence,” “spy,” etc.  </p><p>语义词联想可能不会立即让人想起“有趣”，但它实际上是一场伟大的派对游戏。第一个人说了一个单词，然后人们轮流提出相关的单词，最后的单词通常与原始单词相差甚远。例如，“狗”可能导致“猫”，“爪子”，“尖锐”，“情报”，“间谍”等。</ p><p>Some, however, have seen word association as more than a game. Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung thought that it could reveal people’s emotional problems and unconscious hang-ups. He would have his patients play the word association game, paying careful attention to any hesitations or unexpected responses. If a patient fidgeted when prompted with “mother” and then came back with “eclipse,” Jung would investigate. </p>然而，有些人认为单词关联不仅仅是游戏。瑞士精神分析师Carl Jung认为它可以揭示人们的情绪问题和无意识的困扰。他会让他的病人玩单词关联游戏，注意任何犹豫或意外的反应。如果患者在被提示“母亲”时坐立不安，然后带着“日食”回来，Jung会调查。 </ p><p>More recently, a group of psychologists published a paper claiming that nominative determinism actually works. They found that men named Dennis were more likely to be dentists, the theory being that “people choose – or are unconsciously drawn to – careers that resemble their own names.”  </p><p>最近，一群心理学家发表了一篇论文，声称主格确定性确实有效。他们发现名叫丹尼斯的男性更有可能成为牙医，这个理论是“人们选择 - 或者无意识地吸引 - 那些与自己名字相似的职业。”</ p><p>There are many such examples: Usain Bolt, the fastest man alive; meteorologists Amy Freeze and Sara Blizzard; weight loss guru Dr. Mike Loosemore; chef Tom Kitchin; and my favorite, Canadian police officer Law Power.  </p><p>有很多这样的例子：尤塞恩博尔特，活着最快的人;气象学家Amy Freeze和Sara Blizzard;减肥大师Mike Loosemore博士;厨师Tom Kitchin;还有我最喜欢的加拿大警察Law Power。 </ p><p>But researchers have found problems with the “Dennis” paper and in fact nominative determinism is perhaps nothing more than what academics call a <i>stylized fact</i>, a catchy idea that we feel <i>must</i> be true.

Mr. Comey has been mentioned along with the “comity” of the Senate, of congressional panels, of laws, and even of a White House garden party – “Comity not Comey?” was the headline – last year. It seems to me that this results from word association. “Comey” looks and sounds like comity, so writers move easily from one to the other. We’ll talk more about that next week. This week, let’s look at comity.</p><p>在关于前联邦调查局局长詹姆斯康梅的新闻文章中，“康复”这个词出现频率惊人。科米先生与参议院的“礼让”，国会小组，法律，甚至白宫花园派对一起被提及 - “Comity not Comey？”是标题 - 去年。在我看来，这是由单词关联产生的。 “Comey”看起来和听起来像是礼让，所以作家很容易从一个移动到另一个。我们下周会谈到更多。本周，让我们来看看礼让。</ p><p>In its broadest sense, comity refers to courtesy, to “kindly and considerate behavior towards others,” as the Oxford English Dictionary puts it. A 17th-century etiquette book picked “comity and affability” (ease talking to others; pleasantness) as essential to a good conversation.</p><p>从最广泛的意义上说，礼貌指的是礼貌，即“对他人善意和体贴的行为”，正如“牛津英语词典”所说的那样。一本17世纪的礼仪书选择了“礼让和友善”（轻松与他人交谈;愉快），这对于良好的对话至关重要。</ p><p>Nowadays, though, its use is almost entirely restricted to the political and legal realms. “The comity of nations,” the idea that countries should respect each other’s laws and customs as far as possible, is a guiding principle of international relations. Comity influences relations among US states as well. Legally, it involves reciprocity: You do something for me, and I’ll do the same for you. It means the courts of Massachusetts recognize judgments from Wyoming, and you can drive all over the country on your Wisconsin license.</p><p>如今，它的使用几乎完全局限于政治和法律领域。 “国家的礼让”，即各国应尽可能尊重彼此的法律和习俗，这是国际关系的指导原则。 Comity也影响美国各州之间的关系。从法律上讲，它涉及互惠：你为我做点什么，我会为你做同样的事。这意味着马萨诸塞州的法院承认怀俄明州的判决，你可以在威斯康星州的许可证上开车到全国各地。</ p><p>The US Senate is – or was – strongly associated with ideals of comity. While they are in the chamber, senators employ an almost exaggerated courtesy, referring to each other as “gentlemen” or “gentlewomen” and “esteemed colleagues.” Many of the recent articles about Comey, however, suggest that Senate comity is under threat or already destroyed.    </p><p>美国参议院与礼让的理想密切相关。当他们进入会议室时，参议员们采取了几乎夸张的礼貌，将对方称为“绅士”或“绅士”和“受尊敬的同事”。然而，最近关于科米的许多文章表明，参议院的礼让受到威胁或者已经毁了</ p><p>In terms of the more superficial sense of comity, this is not true. The Senate has strict rules of decorum. Rule 19 of the Senate bans insults, forbidding members from “imput[ing] ... any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator” to others. People who worry about the decline of Senate civility perhaps forget that this rule was enacted in 1902 after one senator physically attacked another for spreading a “willful, malicious, and deliberate lie.” Outwardly, the Senate remains overwhelmingly courteous.    </p><p>就更肤浅的礼让感而言，这不是真的。参议院有严格的礼仪规则。参议院第19条禁止侮辱，禁止成员“向其他人”施加任何行为或动机不值得或不成为参议员“。担心参议院文明衰落的人们可能会忘记，这条规则是在1902年一名参议员实际攻击另一名参与者传播“故意，恶意和蓄意谎言”后制定的。从表面上看，参议院仍然极其礼貌。 </ p><p>But in the more important sense of comity, that of actual respect and reciprocity, things do seem to be going badly. Senators insult each other in interviews and on the campaign trail. Since the 1990s, successive Congresses have struggled to enact laws, partly because partisan scorn puts reciprocity out of the question.  </p><p>但是，在更重要的礼让意义上，实际的尊重和互惠意识，事情似乎确实很糟糕。参议员在采访和竞选过程中互相侮辱。自20世纪90年代以来，历届国会都在努力制定法律，部分原因是党派蔑视使互惠无可置疑。 </ p><p>Affability now sounds like a very old-fashioned virtue. Let’s hope it’s not too late for comity.</p><p>亲和力现在听起来像是一种非常老式的美德。让我们希望礼让还为时不晚。</ p>','2018-10-28 15:52:38','N'),(334,'https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Movies/2018/0427/Avengers-Infinity-War-is-often-like-watching-one-interminable-battle-scene','\'Avengers: Infinity War\' is often like watching one interminable battle scene','<p>\"Avengers: Infinity War\" reportedly cost around $300 million and was 10 years in the making.

Paul Beatty’s novel “The Sellout” features a club that meets <i>bimonthly</i>.

While <i>bi-</i> means “two,” “twice,” or “doubly,” <i>semi-</i> indicates that a given unit of time is halved.

His verse often seems like an interior monologue on which the reader is casually eavesdropping.</p><p>这个愿景取决于菲利普斯的新诗集“狂野是风”</ b>的核心。他的诗经常像是一个内心独白，读者随便偷听。</ p><p>The title of \"Wild is the Wind\" refers to an old jazz standard, but it also neatly chimes with Phillips’s interest in nature. The double meaning of the title underscores his equal fascination with both culture and the outdoors. His poems casually quote Lucretius or Marcus Aurelius while touching on wind and water, woods and bonfires, coyotes and storms. In the title poem, Phillips recalls a time when he lived “at the forest’s edge – metaphorically, so it can sometimes seem now, though the forest was real, as my life beside it was....”</p><p>“Wild is the Wind”的标题是指一种古老的爵士乐标准，但它也与菲利普斯对大自然的兴趣巧妙地吻合。标题的双重含义凸显了他对文化和户外的同等魅力。他的诗随便引用了Lucretius或Marcus Aurelius，同时触及风和水，树林和篝火，土狼和暴风雨。在标题诗中，菲利普斯回忆起他生活在森林边缘的时代 - 隐喻，现在有时看起来像现在，虽然森林是真实的，因为我的生活就在旁边......“</ p><p>One isn’t quite sure what engages Phillips more – the real woods, or the idea of them. The question arises again in “Musculature,” which begins with a discussion of his dog then digresses into a discussion of language and mortality, the canine itself never quite coming into focus.</p><p>人们不太确定菲利普斯更多的是什么 - 真正的树林，或者他们的想法。问题再次出现在“肌肉组织”中，首先讨论他的狗，然后讨论语言和死亡，犬本身从未成为焦点。</ p><p>That’s an abiding challenge with Phillips’s poems, which can become so immersed in intellectual disquisition that they sound aridly abstract.</p><p>这对菲利普斯的诗歌来说是一个持久的挑战，这些诗歌可以沉浸在知识分子中，听起来非常抽象。</ p><p>At his best, though, Phillips has a keen eye for what’s transitory – for those things made all the more beautiful because they can’t last. In “Swimming,” he artfully compares wind-swept trees to a kind of star that a helmsman might steer by, then wistfully asks, “Do people, anymore, even say helmsman?”</p><p>尽管如此，菲利普斯仍然敏锐地关注着什么是短暂的 - 因为那些因为不能持久而变得更加美丽的东西。在“游泳”中，他巧妙地将风吹过的树木与舵手可能引导的那种明星进行比较，然后若有所思地问道：“人们，再说，甚至是舵手？”</ p><p>What results is a poignant moment – the poet using language to preserve a memory, then wondering if language itself, a cherished instrument for passing what’s precious from one age to another, is also vulnerable to time.</p><p>一个令人痛苦的时刻是什么结果 - 诗人用语言来保存记忆，然后想知道语言本身是否是一种珍贵的工具，可以将珍贵的时间从一个时代传递到另一个时代，也很容易受到时间的影响。</ p><p>It’s a problem perhaps only a poet would be anguished by, though another poem, “Brothers in Arms,” shows Phillips coming to terms with the occupational hazards of his vocation: “I’ve always thought gratitude’s the one correct response to having been made, however painfully, to see this life more up close.”          </p><p>这可能是一个问题，或许只有诗人才会感到痛苦，尽管另一首诗“武器兄弟”显示菲利普斯正在接受他职业的职业危害：“我一直认为感恩是一个正确的反应无论如何痛苦地看到这种生活越来越近了。“</ p><p><i>Danny Heitman, a columnist for The Advocate newspaper in Louisiana, is the author of \'A Summer of Birds: John James Audubon at Oakley House.\'</i></p><p> <i> Danny Heitman是路易斯安那州The Advocate报的专栏作家，他是“鸟之夏：奥克利之家的John James Audubon”的作者。</ i> </ p>','2018-10-28 15:52:49','N'),(337,'https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/2018/0426/Belgian-artist-helps-Ethiopia-engineer-the-perfect-chicken','Belgian artist helps Ethiopia engineer the perfect chicken','<p>Researchers in Ethiopia are embarking on a quest to create the perfect chicken for African farmers with an unlikely ally – a Belgian conceptual artist who has spent 20 years crossbreeding indigenous chickens, from China and Egypt to Senegal and Cuba.</p><p>埃塞俄比亚的研究人员正在着手寻找为非洲农民创造完美的鸡肉，这是一个不太可能的盟友 -

He describes his approach as “walking calmly but passionately” toward the goal of peace, falling not for hasty optimism or pessimism.</p><p>这位前人权律师，其父母是来自朝鲜的难民，他的第一年大部分时间都是在温暖和赞美的软外交中度过，以表达金先生和特朗普先生的最佳意图。他将自己的方法描述为“平静而热情地走向和平的目标”，而不是因为仓促的乐观或悲观而下降。</ p><p>He also relies on humility to raise others up.</p><p>他还依靠谦虚来提升他人。</ p><p>Even though Mr. Moon is the prime facilitator of the planned summit, he suggests Trump take the Nobel Peace Prize if peace comes to the Koreas. And he deftly used the Winter Olympics in South Korea to invite – and also pay for – North Korean athletes to attend. That generosity led to a successful North-South summit in April in which Kim was the first North Korean leader to set foot in the South. The two men appeared to get along.</p><p>尽管月亮先生是计划举行的首脑会议的主要推动者，但他建议，如果和平来到朝鲜，特朗普将获得诺贝尔和平奖。他灵巧地利用韩国的冬奥会邀请 - 并支付 - 朝鲜运动员参加。这种慷慨导致了4月份成功的南北峰会，金正日是第一个踏上南方的朝鲜领导人。这两个人似乎相处得很好。</ p><p>Last year, when Kim and Trump were using threats and bombast against each other, Moon quietly advocated dialogue and reconciliation. He worked well with China and Japan to bring those big neighbors on board for the summit. “I am willing to go anywhere for the peace of the Korean Peninsula,” he promised last May after taking office.</p><p>去年，当金正日和特朗普互相威胁和互相攻击时，月亮悄悄地主张对话与和解。他与中国和日本合作良好，将这些大邻居带到峰会上。 “我愿意为朝鲜半岛的和平而去任何地方，”他去年5月上任后承诺。</ p><p>Moon also knows when soft diplomacy needs a touch of hard power. When North Korea fired a test missile last year, he asked the United States to counter with a missile exercise. He also called for greater sanctions on North Korea.</p>月亮也知道软外交何时需要一点硬实力。去年朝鲜发射试射导弹时，他要求美国采取导弹演习。他还呼吁对朝鲜实施更大的制裁。</ p><p>But he relies more on the power of the carrot than the stick, more in applying balm than bombast. After decades of trying to end the North’s nuclear ambitions, South Korea perhaps has finally learned how to use the right mix of soft and hard diplomacy. </p><p>但他更多地依赖胡萝卜的力量而不是棒，更多的是使用润唇膏而不是夸夸其谈。经过几十年试图结束朝鲜的核野心，韩国或许终于学会了如何利用软硬外交的正确组合。 </ p><p>More than anything else, Moon has turned Trump from a hawk on North Korea to a seeker of a peace deal. Trump now speaks of investing resources to “make North Korea great.” To reach this point, Moon has relied on acts of trust and contrition to create what may become a self-reinforcing loop of virtue.</p><p>最重要的是，月亮将特朗普从朝鲜的鹰派转变为和平协议的寻求者。特朗普现在谈到投资资源“让朝鲜变得伟大。”为了达到这一点，Moon依靠信任和忏悔的行为来创造可能成为自我强化的美德循环。</ p><p>If the summit takes places and leads to further diplomacy, Moon deserves much of the credit.

According to the United Nations, the world is experiencing the highest number of displaced people on record, or about 40 million people, in places as diverse as Syria, South Sudan, Nigeria, Yemen, Venezuela, and Myanmar. Millions are fleeing for reasons just as diverse – political turmoil, mass poverty, or ethnic and religious conflict. In Myanmar, many Rohingya women fled just to avoid being raped.</p><p>加拿大对这两个国家的关注既欢迎也欢迎时机。据联合国统计，在叙利亚，南苏丹，尼日利亚，也门，委内瑞拉和缅甸等地区，世界上有记录的流离失所者人数最多，约有4 000万人。数百万人出于各种原因逃离 - 政治动荡，大规模贫困或种族和宗教冲突。在缅甸，许多罗兴亚妇女逃离只是为了避免被强奸。</ p><p>While many Western countries, including the US, are increasing aid to refugees, the need for humanitarian assistance keeps rising even as the West’s ability to address the root causes of each crisis has diminished.

Those who participate in such efforts might be offered halfway houses or home confinement for the final part of their sentence.</p>该法案被称为“第一步法案”，要求监狱局为所有被监禁在联邦监狱的人制定个人计划，以参与教育，职业培训和其他计划。囚犯可以被分配到离家人更近的监狱。那些即将离开监狱的人将获得帮助，建立银行账户和获取身份证。那些参与这些努力的人可能会被判处中途房屋或家庭监禁，以便他们在最后一段时间内获得。</ p><p>In short, the plan relies on the idea that individuals, no matter what their past crimes, are capable of making a choice between right and wrong if given the right support.</p><p>简而言之，该计划依赖的观点是，如果得到适当的支持，个人无论过去的罪行如何，都能够在正确与错误之间做出选择。</ p><p>In early May, the measure was approved by the Judiciary Committee by a 25-to-5 vote.

Why, then, as John Pollack writes in “The Pun Also Rises,” do we consider puns “the lowest form of humor?”</p><p>在今天的美国，我们准备通过呻吟回应双关语。我们将它们描述为“糟糕”，或者，如果我们慷慨，那么“如此糟糕，它们实际上是好的。”我个人认为上面的例子很简单 - 很搞笑，非常聪明。那么，为什么John Pollack在“The Pun Also Rises”中写道，我们是否认为双关语是“幽默的最低形式？”</ p><p>Puns exploit the different possible meanings of a particular word or words that sound similar. They are a subset of a time-honored rhetorical technique, <i>paronomasia</i>, which employs words that resemble each other sometimes for humorous, but more often for serious, effect. The Bible is full of <i>paronomasia</i>. Moses’ name plays on the idea of him being “drawn out” of the river by Pharaoh’s daughter (<i>mosheh</i>, in Hebrew) and being the person who “draws out” (<i>mashah</i>) Israel from bondage in Egypt. Jesus tells his apostle, “you are Peter (Petros), and on this rock (petra) I will build my Church.” These are puns with a purpose; they encourage readers or listeners to engage more deeply with the text.</p><p> Puns利用听起来相似的特定单词或单词的不同含义。它们是历史悠久的修辞技巧的一个子集，<i> paronomasia </ i>，它们使用的词语彼此相似，有时候是幽默的，但更常见的是严肃​​的效果。圣经充满了<i> paronomasia </ i>。摩西的名字意味着他被法老的女儿（<i> mosheh </ i>，希伯来语）“拉出”河流，并成为“抽出”的人（<i> mashah </ i >）以色列在埃及受到奴役。耶稣告诉他的使徒，“你是彼得（彼得罗斯），在这块石头上（佩特拉），我将建造我的教会。”这些是有目的的双关语;他们鼓励读者或听众更深入地参与文本。</ p><p>The Renaissance was the golden age of punning. Shakespeare’s poems and plays contain more than 3,000, from the serious – “Oh, that this too, too solid flesh would melt, thaw, and resolve itself into a dew/ adieu” – to the very bawdy.  </p><p>文艺复兴时期是双关语的黄金时代。莎士比亚的诗歌和戏剧中有超过3000种，其中包括严肃的 - “噢，这太过坚固的肉体会融化，解冻，并将自己融入露水/ ad”中 - 对于那个非常笨拙的人来说。 </ p><p>In the 18th century, though, puns fell from grace. Their multiple meanings were no longer seen as encouraging reflection; rather they were considered a stumbling block to the smooth flow of information. Samuel Johnson hated Shakespeare’s “quibbles,” as he called them, and complained that they continually “checked and blasted” the emotional effect of the plays. Today, puns are “mere” wordplay, possibly funny but never profound.  </p>然而，在18世纪，双关语从恩典中堕落。他们的多重含义不再被视为令人鼓舞的反思;相反，他们被认为是信息畅通的绊脚石。塞缪尔约翰逊憎恨莎士比亚的“狡辩”，并称他们不断“检查并抨击”戏剧的情感效果。今天，双关语是“单纯的”文字游戏，可能有趣但从未深刻。 </ p><p>Because they play with finite sets of word meanings, puns are the one form of joke that computers are consistently able to produce. Some of them are pretty good: “What do you call a beloved mammal? A dear deer.” Some of them aren’t: “What kind of idea melts? A thaw-t.” Certain programs can also evaluate puns, declaring which are funniest.</p><p>因为它们使用有限的单词含义集，所以双关语是计算机始终能够产生的一种笑话形式。其中一些非常好：“你称之为心爱的哺乳动物？亲爱的鹿。“有些人不是：”什么样的想法融化了？解冻。“某些程序也可以评估双关语，宣布哪些是最有趣的。</ p><p>Given that puns are the kind of humor that computers “understand,” perhaps we should rethink our attitude toward them. When the singularity occurs, our robot overlords might keep the punniest among us around.</p><p>鉴于双关语是计算机“理解”的那种幽默，或许我们应该重新思考我们对他们的态度。当奇点出现时，我们的机器人霸主可能会让我们中间最苛刻的人。</ p>','2018-10-28 15:55:29','N'),(345,'https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/TV/2018/0511/What-are-you-watching-Readers-recommend-This-Is-Us-Lost','What are you watching?

We also make phonological (according to sound) and orthographic (according to spelling) associations.

The first person says a word, and then people take turns coming up with related words, with the final word often being quite far from the original. “Dog,” for example, might lead to “cat,” “claw,” “sharp,” “intelligence,” “spy,” etc.  </p><p>语义词联想可能不会立即让人想起“有趣”，但它实际上是一场伟大的派对游戏。第一个人说了一个单词，然后人们轮流提出相关的单词，最后的单词通常与原始单词相差甚远。例如，“狗”可能导致“猫”，“爪子”，“尖锐”，“情报”，“间谍”等。</ p><p>Some, however, have seen word association as more than a game. Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung thought that it could reveal people’s emotional problems and unconscious hang-ups. He would have his patients play the word association game, paying careful attention to any hesitations or unexpected responses. If a patient fidgeted when prompted with “mother” and then came back with “eclipse,” Jung would investigate. </p>然而，有些人认为单词关联不仅仅是游戏。瑞士精神分析师Carl Jung认为它可以揭示人们的情绪问题和无意识的困扰。他会让他的病人玩单词关联游戏，注意任何犹豫或意外的反应。如果患者在被提示“母亲”时坐立不安，然后带着“日食”回来，Jung会调查。 </ p><p>More recently, a group of psychologists published a paper claiming that nominative determinism actually works.

Mr. Comey has been mentioned along with the “comity” of the Senate, of congressional panels, of laws, and even of a White House garden party – “Comity not Comey?” was the headline – last year. It seems to me that this results from word association. “Comey” looks and sounds like comity, so writers move easily from one to the other. We’ll talk more about that next week. This week, let’s look at comity.</p><p>在关于前联邦调查局局长詹姆斯康梅的新闻文章中，“康复”这个词出现频率惊人。科米先生与参议院的“礼让”，国会小组，法律，甚至白宫花园派对一起被提及 - “Comity not Comey？”是标题 - 去年。在我看来，这是由单词关联产生的。 “Comey”看起来和听起来像是礼让，所以作家很容易从一个移动到另一个。我们下周会谈到更多。本周，让我们来看看礼让。</ p><p>In its broadest sense, comity refers to courtesy, to “kindly and considerate behavior towards others,” as the Oxford English Dictionary puts it. A 17th-century etiquette book picked “comity and affability” (ease talking to others; pleasantness) as essential to a good conversation.</p><p>从最广泛的意义上说，礼貌指的是礼貌，即“对他人善意和体贴的行为”，正如“牛津英语词典”所说的那样。一本17世纪的礼仪书选择了“礼让和友善”（轻松与他人交谈;愉快），这对于良好的对话至关重要。</ p><p>Nowadays, though, its use is almost entirely restricted to the political and legal realms. “The comity of nations,” the idea that countries should respect each other’s laws and customs as far as possible, is a guiding principle of international relations. Comity influences relations among US states as well. Legally, it involves reciprocity: You do something for me, and I’ll do the same for you. It means the courts of Massachusetts recognize judgments from Wyoming, and you can drive all over the country on your Wisconsin license.</p><p>如今，它的使用几乎完全局限于政治和法律领域。 “国家的礼让”，即各国应尽可能尊重彼此的法律和习俗，这是国际关系的指导原则。 Comity也影响美国各州之间的关系。从法律上讲，它涉及互惠：你为我做点什么，我会为你做同样的事。这意味着马萨诸塞州的法院承认怀俄明州的判决，你可以在威斯康星州的许可证上开车到全国各地。</ p><p>The US Senate is – or was – strongly associated with ideals of comity. While they are in the chamber, senators employ an almost exaggerated courtesy, referring to each other as “gentlemen” or “gentlewomen” and “esteemed colleagues.” Many of the recent articles about Comey, however, suggest that Senate comity is under threat or already destroyed.    </p><p>美国参议院与礼让的理想密切相关。当他们进入会议室时，参议员们采取了几乎夸张的礼貌，将对方称为“绅士”或“绅士”和“受尊敬的同事”。然而，最近关于科米的许多文章表明，参议院的礼让受到威胁或者已经毁了</ p><p>In terms of the more superficial sense of comity, this is not true. The Senate has strict rules of decorum. Rule 19 of the Senate bans insults, forbidding members from “imput[ing] ... any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator” to others. People who worry about the decline of Senate civility perhaps forget that this rule was enacted in 1902 after one senator physically attacked another for spreading a “willful, malicious, and deliberate lie.” Outwardly, the Senate remains overwhelmingly courteous.    </p><p>就更肤浅的礼让感而言，这不是真的。参议院有严格的礼仪规则。参议院第19条禁止侮辱，禁止成员“向其他人”施加任何行为或动机不值得或不成为参议员“。担心参议院文明衰落的人们可能会忘记，这条规则是在1902年一名参议员实际攻击另一名参与者传播“故意，恶意和蓄意谎言”后制定的。从表面上看，参议院仍然极其礼貌。 </ p><p>But in the more important sense of comity, that of actual respect and reciprocity, things do seem to be going badly. Senators insult each other in interviews and on the campaign trail. Since the 1990s, successive Congresses have struggled to enact laws, partly because partisan scorn puts reciprocity out of the question.  </p><p>但是，在更重要的礼让意义上，实际的尊重和互惠意识，事情似乎确实很糟糕。参议员在采访和竞选过程中互相侮辱。自20世纪90年代以来，历届国会都在努力制定法律，部分原因是党派蔑视使互惠无可置疑。 </ p><p>Affability now sounds like a very old-fashioned virtue. Let’s hope it’s not too late for comity.</p><p>亲和力现在听起来像是一种非常老式的美德。让我们希望礼让还为时不晚。</ p>','2018-10-28 15:55:34','N'),(348,'https://www.csmonitor.com/Books/Book-Reviews/2018/0406/Wild-is-the-Wind-explores-those-things-made-all-the-more-beautiful-because-they-can-t-last','\'Wild is the Wind\' explores those things made all the more beautiful because they can’t last','<p>In \"Coin of the Realm,\" a collection of critical essays that he published in 2004, Carl Phillips outlined a literary sensibility that’s helpful to keep in mind while reading his poems. “For me, to write is a form of prayer, however secular the subject of the writing at hand,” he told readers. “Writing is as private as prayer – it contains, as prayer does, an implicit faith in there being somewhere a listener and at the same time a sober realization that prayer is finally one-directional.”</p><p>在“王国的硬币”中，卡尔·菲利普斯在2004年出版的一系列批评文章中概述了一种文学敏感性，这有助于在阅读他的诗歌时牢记这一点。 “对我来说，写作是一种祈祷形式，不论世俗是手头写作的主题，”他告诉读者。 “写作与祷告一样私密 - 它像祷告一样包含一种隐含的信念，即在某个地方有一个听众，同时清醒地认识到祷告最终是单向的。”</ p><p>That vision rests at the heart of <b>Wild is the Wind</b>, Phillips’s new collection of poems. His verse often seems like an interior monologue on which the reader is casually eavesdropping.</p><p>这个愿景取决于菲利普斯的新诗集“狂野是风”</ b>的核心。他的诗经常像是一个内心独白，读者随便偷听。</ p><p>The title of \"Wild is the Wind\" refers to an old jazz standard, but it also neatly chimes with Phillips’s interest in nature. The double meaning of the title underscores his equal fascination with both culture and the outdoors. His poems casually quote Lucretius or Marcus Aurelius while touching on wind and water, woods and bonfires, coyotes and storms. In the title poem, Phillips recalls a time when he lived “at the forest’s edge – metaphorically, so it can sometimes seem now, though the forest was real, as my life beside it was....”</p><p>“Wild is the Wind”的标题是指一种古老的爵士乐标准，但它也与菲利普斯对大自然的兴趣巧妙地吻合。标题的双重含义凸显了他对文化和户外的同等魅力。他的诗随便引用了Lucretius或Marcus Aurelius，同时触及风和水，树林和篝火，土狼和暴风雨。在标题诗中，菲利普斯回忆起他生活在森林边缘的时代 - 隐喻，现在有时看起来像现在，虽然森林是真实的，因为我的生活就在旁边......“</ p><p>One isn’t quite sure what engages Phillips more – the real woods, or the idea of them. The question arises again in “Musculature,” which begins with a discussion of his dog then digresses into a discussion of language and mortality, the canine itself never quite coming into focus.</p><p>人们不太确定菲利普斯更多的是什么 - 真正的树林，或者他们的想法。问题再次出现在“肌肉组织”中，首先讨论他的狗，然后讨论语言和死亡，犬本身从未成为焦点。</ p><p>That’s an abiding challenge with Phillips’s poems, which can become so immersed in intellectual disquisition that they sound aridly abstract.</p><p>这对菲利普斯的诗歌来说是一个持久的挑战，这些诗歌可以沉浸在知识分子中，听起来非常抽象。</ p><p>At his best, though, Phillips has a keen eye for what’s transitory – for those things made all the more beautiful because they can’t last. In “Swimming,” he artfully compares wind-swept trees to a kind of star that a helmsman might steer by, then wistfully asks, “Do people, anymore, even say helmsman?”</p><p>尽管如此，菲利普斯仍然敏锐地关注着什么是短暂的 - 因为那些因为不能持久而变得更加美丽的东西。在“游泳”中，他巧妙地将风吹过的树木与舵手可能引导的那种明星进行比较，然后若有所思地问道：“人们，再说，甚至是舵手？”</ p><p>What results is a poignant moment – the poet using language to preserve a memory, then wondering if language itself, a cherished instrument for passing what’s precious from one age to another, is also vulnerable to time.</p><p>一个令人痛苦的时刻是什么结果 - 诗人用语言来保存记忆，然后想知道语言本身是否是一种珍贵的工具，可以将珍贵的时间从一个时代传递到另一个时代，也很容易受到时间的影响。</ p><p>It’s a problem perhaps only a poet would be anguished by, though another poem, “Brothers in Arms,” shows Phillips coming to terms with the occupational hazards of his vocation: “I’ve always thought gratitude’s the one correct response to having been made, however painfully, to see this life more up close.”          </p><p>这可能是一个问题，或许只有诗人才会感到痛苦，尽管另一首诗“武器兄弟”显示菲利普斯正在接受他职业的职业危害：“我一直认为感恩是一个正确的反应无论如何痛苦地看到这种生活越来越近了。“</ p><p><i>Danny Heitman, a columnist for The Advocate newspaper in Louisiana, is the author of \'A Summer of Birds: John James Audubon at Oakley House.\'</i></p><p> <i> Danny Heitman是路易斯安那州The Advocate报的专栏作家，他是“鸟之夏：奥克利之家的John James Audubon”的作者。</ i> </ p>','2018-10-28 15:55:43','N'),(349,'https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/A-Christian-Science-Perspective/2018/0529/Value-that-s-not-contingent-on-circumstance','Value that’s not contingent on circumstance','<p>A woman I know spent her early years wishing she’d never been born.

The impact, though limited to firms operating in Europe, is being felt globally.</p><p>欧洲与美国之间的健康竞赛之一就是可以设定新的全球标准。 5月25日，欧盟开始在一个标准 - 数字隐私 - 上获胜，开始对公司处理个人数据的方式采取严格规定。这种影响虽然仅限于在欧洲运营的公司，但却在全球范围内受到影响。</ p><p>In another type of standard, however, Europe has only begun to compete with the US.</p><p>然而，在另一种标准中，欧洲才开始与美国竞争。</ p><p>Corruption still pervades many countries on the Continent. The latest example is the May 24 sentencing of 29 people in Spain’s ruling Popular Party related to a massive scheme involving kickbacks. Another is the alleged bribery of members of the Council of Europe’s parliamentary assembly by Azerbaijan for remaining silent on discussions of human rights violations in that Central Asian country.</p><p>腐败仍然遍及欧洲大陆的许多国家。最新的例子是5月24日西班牙执政党29人的判决，涉及一项涉及回扣的大规模计划。另一个是阿塞拜疆谴责欧洲委员会议会议员贿赂，以保持沉默，讨论该中亚国家的侵犯人权行为。</ p><p>Yet one by one, more European nations from Ireland to Slovakia are tightening enforcement of anti-graft rules, especially against companies that operate overseas. For years, many governments have turned a blind eye toward bribery of foreign officials on a dubious assumption that their domestic firms might lose business.</p><p>然而，从爱尔兰到斯洛伐克的更多欧洲国家正在逐步加强反贪污规则的执行，特别是针对在海外经营的公司。多年来，许多政府对外国官员的贿赂视而不见，他们怀疑国内公司可能会失去业务。</ p><p>In France, for example, people were shocked in April when a powerful businessman, Vincent Bolloré, was held in jail and questioned over suspected graft in Africa. The move, however, is the result of what is considered a cultural revolution in France. A new law that took effect last year, known as Sapin II, set up a new anti-corruption agency and gives prosecutors new tools to deal with corporate corruption abroad. At least three companies have already settled with the new agency in cases involving bribery of a foreign official.</p>例如，在法国，四月份当一位强大的商人VincentBolloré被关押在监狱并对非洲嫌疑人的嫌疑人提出质疑时，人们感到震惊。然而，此举是法国文化革命的结果。去年生效的一项新法律，即Sapin II，成立了一个新的反腐败机构，并为检察官提供了处理海外公司腐败的新工具。在涉及贿赂外国官员的案件中，至少有三家公司已与新机构达成和解。</ p><p>The new French law is similar to Britain’s Bribery Act of 2010, which itself is based on a ground-breaking law in the US, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977. The US law has been effective in catching many European companies, an embarrassment that has proved an incentive for EU member states to toughen up their own laws. Germany, for example, has cracked down on its firms after the US settled a case with the German engineering firm Siemens in 2008. </p><p>新法国法律类似于2010年英国的“反贿赂法”，该法案本身是基于美国的一项开创性法律，即1977年的“反海外腐败法”。美国法律在捕捉许多欧洲公司方面非常有效，这种尴尬已被证明是欧盟成员国加强自身法律的一种动力。例如，在美国于2008年与德国工程公司西门子达成协议后，德国对其公司进行了打击。</ p><p>With each new anti-graft law in Europe, the US finds it easier to work with European officials on cases of transnational corruption. On both sides of the Atlantic, governments are rising to higher standards of honesty, transparency, and accountability. Together, they may ultimately set a new global standard.</p><p>随着欧洲每一项新的反贪法律，美国发现在跨国腐败案件中与欧洲官员合作更容易。在大西洋两岸，各国政府正在提高诚信度，透明度和问责制的标准。他们可能最终共同制定新的全球标准。</ p><p> </p><P> </ p>','2018-10-28 15:56:57','N'),(351,'https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/A-Christian-Science-Perspective/2018/0524/Charity-begins-at-home','‘Charity begins at home’','<p>In college, I came in contact with <a href=\"http://christianscience.com/what-is-christian-science\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Christian Science</a> teachings for the first time. The idea that we are lovingly cared for by God, who created us as His spiritual offspring, was eye-opening to me. As I better understood these ideas, I witnessed the resolution of all kinds of problems through the power of prayer alone. It was so exciting! And I thought my dad could really benefit from this spiritual view of life. He had been an alcoholic for as long as I could remember. But he mistakenly thought that Christian Science was a cult, and we started to have bitter fights over it.</p><p>在大学期间，我接触了<a href=\"http://christianscience.com/what-is-christian-science\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">基督教科学</a>的教导首次。我们被上帝精心照顾的想法，创造了我们作为他的属灵后代，对我来说是令人大开眼界的。当我更好地理解这些想法时，我亲眼目睹了通过祈祷的力量解决各种问题。太令人兴奋了！而且我认为我的父亲可以从这种精神生活观中受益。只要我记得，他就是酒鬼。但他错误地认为基督教科学是一种邪教，我们开始对它进行激烈的斗争。</ p><p>At one point I realized that if what Christian Science teaches is true, then we are so much more than flawed mortals who are prone to mistakes, because that is not how God has made us. And I saw that my need was not to convince my dad of this but to change my own perspective – to recognize the spiritual reality of his, and everyone’s, real nature. To really understand it.</p><p>有一次，我意识到，如果基督教科学所教导的是真实的，那么我们就不仅仅是容易出错的有瑕疵的凡人，因为这不是上帝创造我们的方式。而且我看到我的需要不是说服我的父亲，而是改变我自己的观点 - 认识到他和每个人的真实本性的精神现实。要真正理解它。</ p><p>There’s a line from “Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,” written by <a href=\"http://christianscience.com/what-is-christian-science/mary-baker-eddy\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mary Baker Eddy</a>, the discoverer of Christian Science, that really speaks to me in this regard. It’s about the Christ, God’s message of love for everyone, that brings reformation and healing to all who are willing to receive it. The line reads in part, “… mortals need only turn from sin and lose sight of mortal selfhood to find Christ, the real man and his relation to God, and to recognize the divine sonship” (<a href=\"https://concordexpress.christianscience.com/?query=SH%20316:3-7\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">p. 316</a>).</p><p>“科学与健康与圣经的关键”中有一句话，由<a href =“http://christianscience.com/what-is-christian-science/mary-baker-eddy”rel =“撰写noopener“target =”_ blank“> Mary Baker Eddy </a>，基督教科学的发现者，在这方面真的对我说话。它是关于基督，上帝对每个人的爱的信息，为所有愿意接受它的人带来改革和医治。这条线部分地写着：“凡人只需要从罪恶中转身，看不到凡人的自我，找到基督，真正的男人和他与上帝的关系，并认识到神圣的儿子”（<a href =“https：// concordexpress.christianscience.com/?query=SH%20316：3-7“rel =”noopener“target =”_ blank“> p.316 </a>。</ p><p>Again, I saw that this wasn’t something I had to persuade my dad to do. It was what I started consciously doing when thinking of my dad: seeing him in the light of these ideas. I started to see a new man, a spiritual and wholly good man, a man whose relation to God had never been broken and could never be broken. Shortly after this he stopped drinking for good, and with that he became more appreciative of Christian Science. Our relationship became even richer.</p><p>再次，我看到这不是我必须说服我父亲去做的事情。这是我在想到我父亲时开始有意识地做的事情：根据这些想法来看他。我开始看到一个新人，一个属灵的，完全善良的人，一个与上帝的关系从未被打破过，永远不会被打破的人。在此之后不久，他停止了喝酒，并因此更加欣赏基督教科学。我们的关系变得更加富裕。</ p><p>There’s an aphorism, “Charity begins at home,” and I think that applies especially to our own thinking. When we strive to see the individual of God’s making, this inevitably helps us and others to experience more of our God-given health and purity. And we find ourselves in possession of life’s finest moments and memories.</p><p>有一句格言，“慈善从家里开始”，我认为这尤其适用于我们自己的想法。当我们努力去看上帝的个体时，这不可避免地帮助我们和其他人更多地体验我们上帝赐予的健康和纯洁。我们发现自己拥有生命中最美好的时刻和回忆。</ p><p><i>Adapted from the May 3, 2018, <a href=\"https://www.christianscience.com/christian-healing-today/daily-lift\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Christian Science Daily Lift podcast</a>.</i></p><p> <i>改编自2018年5月3日，<a href=\"https://www.christianscience.com/christian-healing-today/daily-lift\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">基督教科学每日电梯播客</a>。</ i> </ p>','2018-10-28 15:57:07','N'),(352,'https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2018/0523/The-deft-broker-behind-plans-for-a-Trump-Kim-summit','The deft broker behind plans for a Trump-Kim summit','<p>If President Trump’s anticipated summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un actually takes place on June 12, perhaps no one will deserve more credit than a person who prefers not to take credit: President Moon Jae-in of South Korea.</p><p>如果特朗普总统预计将于6月12日与朝鲜领导人金正恩举行首脑会议，那么也许没有人比不喜欢信用的人更值得信任：韩国总统Moon Jae-in。 / p><p>The former humans rights lawyer, whose parents were refugees from North Korea, has spent much of his first year in office using the soft diplomacy of warmth and praise to bring out the best intentions of both Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump. He describes his approach as “walking calmly but passionately” toward the goal of peace, falling not for hasty optimism or pessimism.</p><p>这位前人权律师，其父母是来自朝鲜的难民，他的第一年大部分时间都是在温暖和赞美的软外交中度过，以表达金先生和特朗普先生的最佳意图。他将自己的方法描述为“平静而热情地走向和平的目标”，而不是因为仓促的乐观或悲观而下降。</ p><p>He also relies on humility to raise others up.</p><p>他还依靠谦虚来提升他人。</ p><p>Even though Mr. Moon is the prime facilitator of the planned summit, he suggests Trump take the Nobel Peace Prize if peace comes to the Koreas. And he deftly used the Winter Olympics in South Korea to invite – and also pay for – North Korean athletes to attend. That generosity led to a successful North-South summit in April in which Kim was the first North Korean leader to set foot in the South. The two men appeared to get along.</p><p>尽管月亮先生是计划举行的首脑会议的主要推动者，但他建议，如果和平来到朝鲜，特朗普将获得诺贝尔和平奖。他灵巧地利用韩国的冬奥会邀请 - 并支付 - 朝鲜运动员参加。这种慷慨导致了4月份成功的南北峰会，金正日是第一个踏上南方的朝鲜领导人。这两个人似乎相处得很好。</ p><p>Last year, when Kim and Trump were using threats and bombast against each other, Moon quietly advocated dialogue and reconciliation. He worked well with China and Japan to bring those big neighbors on board for the summit. “I am willing to go anywhere for the peace of the Korean Peninsula,” he promised last May after taking office.</p><p>去年，当金正日和特朗普互相威胁和互相攻击时，月亮悄悄地主张对话与和解。他与中国和日本合作良好，将这些大邻居带到峰会上。 “我愿意为朝鲜半岛的和平而去任何地方，”他去年5月上任后承诺。</ p><p>Moon also knows when soft diplomacy needs a touch of hard power. When North Korea fired a test missile last year, he asked the United States to counter with a missile exercise. He also called for greater sanctions on North Korea.</p>月亮也知道软外交何时需要一点硬实力。去年朝鲜发射试射导弹时，他要求美国采取导弹演习。他还呼吁对朝鲜实施更大的制裁。</ p><p>But he relies more on the power of the carrot than the stick, more in applying balm than bombast. After decades of trying to end the North’s nuclear ambitions, South Korea perhaps has finally learned how to use the right mix of soft and hard diplomacy. </p><p>但他更多地依赖胡萝卜的力量而不是棒，更多的是使用润唇膏而不是夸夸其谈。经过几十年试图结束朝鲜的核野心，韩国或许终于学会了如何利用软硬外交的正确组合。 </ p><p>More than anything else, Moon has turned Trump from a hawk on North Korea to a seeker of a peace deal. Trump now speaks of investing resources to “make North Korea great.” To reach this point, Moon has relied on acts of trust and contrition to create what may become a self-reinforcing loop of virtue.</p><p>最重要的是，月亮将特朗普从朝鲜的鹰派转变为和平协议的寻求者。特朗普现在谈到投资资源“让朝鲜变得伟大。”为了达到这一点，Moon依靠信任和忏悔的行为来创造可能成为自我强化的美德循环。</ p><p>If the summit takes places and leads to further diplomacy, Moon deserves much of the credit. But he may not accept it.</p><p>如果峰会举行并导致进一步的外交，Moon应该得到很多的赞誉。但他可能不会接受它。</ p>','2018-10-28 15:57:08','N'),(353,'https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2018/0522/A-G7-summit-with-hospitality-on-the-table','A G7 summit with hospitality on the table','<p>As befits its reputation for generosity, Canada is ranked in the top four of nations most accepting of migrants, according to a recent Gallup poll.

An estimated 5,000 Venezuelans a day are fleeing to neighboring countries, a result of mass hunger and poverty under a dictatorial regime. The number seeking asylum in the US jumped last year by 88 percent. And after a sham election in Venezuela last Sunday, the total number of migrants is expected to rise from 1.5 million to 2 million by year’s end.</p><p>此外，加拿大总理贾斯汀特鲁多在G7议程上提出了一个相关主题：委内瑞拉，也是最近的大规模移民来源。据估计，每天有5000名委内瑞拉人逃往邻国，这是独裁政权下大规模饥饿和贫困的结果。去年在美国寻求庇护的人数增加了88％。在委内瑞拉上周日举行的一次虚假选举之后，预计到年底移民总人数将从150万增加到200万。</ p><p>Canada’s spotlight on these two countries is both welcome and well timed. According to the United Nations, the world is experiencing the highest number of displaced people on record, or about 40 million people, in places as diverse as Syria, South Sudan, Nigeria, Yemen, Venezuela, and Myanmar. Millions are fleeing for reasons just as diverse – political turmoil, mass poverty, or ethnic and religious conflict. In Myanmar, many Rohingya women fled just to avoid being raped.</p><p>加拿大对这两个国家的关注既欢迎也欢迎时机。据联合国统计，在叙利亚，南苏丹，尼日利亚，也门，委内瑞拉和缅甸等地区，世界上有记录的流离失所者人数最多，约有4 000万人。数百万人出于各种原因逃离 - 政治动荡，大规模贫困或种族和宗教冲突。在缅甸，许多罗兴亚妇女逃离只是为了避免被强奸。</ p><p>While many Western countries, including the US, are increasing aid to refugees, the need for humanitarian assistance keeps rising even as the West’s ability to address the root causes of each crisis has diminished. Canada hopes to start a fix for all this by focusing the G7 summit on ways to influence the leaders of Myanmar and Venezuela.</p><p>虽然包括美国在内的许多西方国家正在增加对难民的援助，但即使西方解决每次危机的根本原因的能力已经减弱，人道主义援助的需求也在不断增加。加拿大希望通过将G7峰会的重点放在影响缅甸和委内瑞拉领导人的方式上来解决所有这些问题。</ p><p>Western democracies have a big stake in such a difficult task. Anti-immigrant feelings are disrupting their politics, reflected in Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, and the rise of extremist parties in many EU nations. Voters increasingly fear a loss of national sovereignty, local community, and rule of law.</p><p>西方民主国家在如此艰巨的任务中占有很大的份额。反移民的情绪正在破坏他们的政治，反映在英国投票离开欧盟，以及许多欧盟国家极端主义政党的崛起。选民越来越害怕失去国家主权，当地社区和法治。</ p><p>Like many other global issues, mass migration needs to be on the agenda of world leaders.

So it is with some surprise that the US House of Representatives appears ready to pass a bipartisan bill that would improve rehabilitation programs in federal prisons, better preparing inmates for a crime-free life and a possible reduction of their time behind bars.</p><p>美国对监狱中赎回者的能力的信念往往是基于哪个政党负责执法的起伏。因此，令人惊讶的是，美国众议院似乎已准备好通过一项两党法案，该法案将改善联邦监狱的康复计划，更好地为无犯罪生活准备囚犯，并可能减少他们在监狱里的时间。</ p ><p>Support of the bill by both Democrats and Republicans may be a result of recent reforms in many states, such as Texas and Georgia, that have helped ex-convicts develop life skills for reintegrating into a community – the kind of reforms that many experts attribute in part to the nation’s lower crime rate in recent decades.</p><p>民主党人和共和党人对该法案的支持可能是由于德克萨斯州和格鲁吉亚等许多州最近的改革，这些改革帮助前罪犯发展了重新融入社区的生活技能 - 这种改革很多专家们认为，近几十年来国家的犯罪率较低。</ p><p>The bill, known as the First Step Act, calls for the Bureau of Prisons to create individual plans for all people incarcerated in federal prisons to participate in education, job training, and other programs.

Those who participate in such efforts might be offered halfway houses or home confinement for the final part of their sentence.</p>该法案被称为“第一步法案”，要求监狱局为所有被监禁在联邦监狱的人制定个人计划，以参与教育，职业培训和其他计划。囚犯可以被分配到离家人更近的监狱。那些即将离开监狱的人将获得帮助，建立银行账户和获取身份证。那些参与这些努力的人可能会被判处中途房屋或家庭监禁，以便他们在最后一段时间内获得。</ p><p>In short, the plan relies on the idea that individuals, no matter what their past crimes, are capable of making a choice between right and wrong if given the right support.</p><p>简而言之，该计划依赖的观点是，如果得到适当的支持，个人无论过去的罪行如何，都能够在正确与错误之间做出选择。</ p><p>In early May, the measure was approved by the Judiciary Committee by a 25-to-5 vote.

We describe them as “bad,” or, if we’re generous, as “so bad, they’re actually good.” I personally think the example above is just plain good – hilarious and very clever.

They are a subset of a time-honored rhetorical technique, <i>paronomasia</i>, which employs words that resemble each other sometimes for humorous, but more often for serious, effect. The Bible is full of <i>paronomasia</i>. Moses’ name plays on the idea of him being “drawn out” of the river by Pharaoh’s daughter (<i>mosheh</i>, in Hebrew) and being the person who “draws out” (<i>mashah</i>) Israel from bondage in Egypt. Jesus tells his apostle, “you are Peter (Petros), and on this rock (petra) I will build my Church.” These are puns with a purpose; they encourage readers or listeners to engage more deeply with the text.</p><p> Puns利用听起来相似的特定单词或单词的不同含义。它们是历史悠久的修辞技巧的一个子集，<i> paronomasia </ i>，它们使用的词语彼此相似，有时候是幽默的，但更常见的是严肃​​的效果。圣经充满了<i> paronomasia </ i>。摩西的名字意味着他被法老的女儿（<i> mosheh </ i>，希伯来语）“拉出”河流，并成为“抽出”的人（<i> mashah </ i >）以色列在埃及受到奴役。耶稣告诉他的使徒，“你是彼得（彼得罗斯），在这块石头上（佩特拉），我将建造我的教会。”这些是有目的的双关语;他们鼓励读者或听众更深入地参与文本。</ p><p>The Renaissance was the golden age of punning. Shakespeare’s poems and plays contain more than 3,000, from the serious – “Oh, that this too, too solid flesh would melt, thaw, and resolve itself into a dew/ adieu” – to the very bawdy.  </p><p>文艺复兴时期是双关语的黄金时代。莎士比亚的诗歌和戏剧中有超过3000种，其中包括严肃的 - “噢，这太过坚固的肉体会融化，解冻，并将自己融入露水/ ad”中 - 对于那个非常笨拙的人来说。 </ p><p>In the 18th century, though, puns fell from grace. Their multiple meanings were no longer seen as encouraging reflection; rather they were considered a stumbling block to the smooth flow of information. Samuel Johnson hated Shakespeare’s “quibbles,” as he called them, and complained that they continually “checked and blasted” the emotional effect of the plays. Today, puns are “mere” wordplay, possibly funny but never profound.  </p>然而，在18世纪，双关语从恩典中堕落。他们的多重含义不再被视为令人鼓舞的反思;相反，他们被认为是信息畅通的绊脚石。塞缪尔约翰逊憎恨莎士比亚的“狡辩”，并称他们不断“检查并抨击”戏剧的情感效果。今天，双关语是“单纯的”文字游戏，可能有趣但从未深刻。 </ p><p>Because they play with finite sets of word meanings, puns are the one form of joke that computers are consistently able to produce. Some of them are pretty good: “What do you call a beloved mammal? A dear deer.” Some of them aren’t: “What kind of idea melts? A thaw-t.” Certain programs can also evaluate puns, declaring which are funniest.</p><p>因为它们使用有限的单词含义集，所以双关语是计算机始终能够产生的一种笑话形式。其中一些非常好：“你称之为心爱的哺乳动物？亲爱的鹿。“有些人不是：”什么样的想法融化了？解冻。“某些程序也可以评估双关语，宣布哪些是最有趣的。</ p><p>Given that puns are the kind of humor that computers “understand,” perhaps we should rethink our attitude toward them.

Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung thought that it could reveal people’s emotional problems and unconscious hang-ups. He would have his patients play the word association game, paying careful attention to any hesitations or unexpected responses. If a patient fidgeted when prompted with “mother” and then came back with “eclipse,” Jung would investigate. </p>然而，有些人认为单词关联不仅仅是游戏。瑞士精神分析师Carl Jung认为它可以揭示人们的情绪问题和无意识的困扰。他会让他的病人玩单词关联游戏，注意任何犹豫或意外的反应。如果患者在被提示“母亲”时坐立不安，然后带着“日食”回来，Jung会调查。 </ p><p>More recently, a group of psychologists published a paper claiming that nominative determinism actually works.

His verse often seems like an interior monologue on which the reader is casually eavesdropping.</p><p>这个愿景取决于菲利普斯的新诗集“狂野是风”</ b>的核心。他的诗经常像是一个内心独白，读者随便偷听。</ p><p>The title of \"Wild is the Wind\" refers to an old jazz standard, but it also neatly chimes with Phillips’s interest in nature. The double meaning of the title underscores his equal fascination with both culture and the outdoors. His poems casually quote Lucretius or Marcus Aurelius while touching on wind and water, woods and bonfires, coyotes and storms. In the title poem, Phillips recalls a time when he lived “at the forest’s edge – metaphorically, so it can sometimes seem now, though the forest was real, as my life beside it was....”</p><p>“Wild is the Wind”的标题是指一种古老的爵士乐标准，但它也与菲利普斯对大自然的兴趣巧妙地吻合。标题的双重含义凸显了他对文化和户外的同等魅力。他的诗随便引用了Lucretius或Marcus Aurelius，同时触及风和水，树林和篝火，土狼和暴风雨。在标题诗中，菲利普斯回忆起他生活在森林边缘的时代 - 隐喻，现在有时看起来像现在，虽然森林是真实的，因为我的生活就在旁边......“</ p><p>One isn’t quite sure what engages Phillips more – the real woods, or the idea of them. The question arises again in “Musculature,” which begins with a discussion of his dog then digresses into a discussion of language and mortality, the canine itself never quite coming into focus.</p><p>人们不太确定菲利普斯更多的是什么 - 真正的树林，或者他们的想法。问题再次出现在“肌肉组织”中，首先讨论他的狗，然后讨论语言和死亡，犬本身从未成为焦点。</ p><p>That’s an abiding challenge with Phillips’s poems, which can become so immersed in intellectual disquisition that they sound aridly abstract.</p><p>这对菲利普斯的诗歌来说是一个持久的挑战，这些诗歌可以沉浸在知识分子中，听起来非常抽象。</ p><p>At his best, though, Phillips has a keen eye for what’s transitory – for those things made all the more beautiful because they can’t last. In “Swimming,” he artfully compares wind-swept trees to a kind of star that a helmsman might steer by, then wistfully asks, “Do people, anymore, even say helmsman?”</p><p>尽管如此，菲利普斯仍然敏锐地关注着什么是短暂的 - 因为那些因为不能持久而变得更加美丽的东西。在“游泳”中，他巧妙地将风吹过的树木与舵手可能引导的那种明星进行比较，然后若有所思地问道：“人们，再说，甚至是舵手？”</ p><p>What results is a poignant moment – the poet using language to preserve a memory, then wondering if language itself, a cherished instrument for passing what’s precious from one age to another, is also vulnerable to time.</p><p>一个令人痛苦的时刻是什么结果 - 诗人用语言来保存记忆，然后想知道语言本身是否是一种珍贵的工具，可以将珍贵的时间从一个时代传递到另一个时代，也很容易受到时间的影响。</ p><p>It’s a problem perhaps only a poet would be anguished by, though another poem, “Brothers in Arms,” shows Phillips coming to terms with the occupational hazards of his vocation: “I’ve always thought gratitude’s the one correct response to having been made, however painfully, to see this life more up close.”          </p><p>这可能是一个问题，或许只有诗人才会感到痛苦，尽管另一首诗“武器兄弟”显示菲利普斯正在接受他职业的职业危害：“我一直认为感恩是一个正确的反应无论如何痛苦地看到这种生活越来越近了。“</ p><p><i>Danny Heitman, a columnist for The Advocate newspaper in Louisiana, is the author of \'A Summer of Birds: John James Audubon at Oakley House.\'</i></p><p> <i> Danny Heitman是路易斯安那州The Advocate报的专栏作家，他是“鸟之夏：奥克利之家的John James Audubon”的作者。</ i> </ p>','2018-10-28 15:57:57','N'),(361,'https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2018/0601/Spain-s-grand-example-for-Europe','Spain’s grand example for Europe','<p>Europe has never seen anything quite like it.</p><p>欧洲从来没有见过这样的东西。</ p><p>For the past six years, prosecutors and judges in Spain have been on a roll against corruption, backed by rising demands for accountability in government.

On May 25, the European Union began to win on one standard – digital privacy – with the start of stiff rules on how companies handle personal data. The impact, though limited to firms operating in Europe, is being felt globally.</p><p>欧洲与美国之间的健康竞赛之一就是可以设定新的全球标准。 5月25日，欧盟开始在一个标准 - 数字隐私 - 上获胜，开始对公司处理个人数据的方式采取严格规定。这种影响虽然仅限于在欧洲运营的公司，但却在全球范围内受到影响。</ p><p>In another type of standard, however, Europe has only begun to compete with the US.</p><p>然而，在另一种标准中，欧洲才开始与美国竞争。</ p><p>Corruption still pervades many countries on the Continent. The latest example is the May 24 sentencing of 29 people in Spain’s ruling Popular Party related to a massive scheme involving kickbacks. Another is the alleged bribery of members of the Council of Europe’s parliamentary assembly by Azerbaijan for remaining silent on discussions of human rights violations in that Central Asian country.</p><p>腐败仍然遍及欧洲大陆的许多国家。最新的例子是5月24日西班牙执政党29人的判决，涉及一项涉及回扣的大规模计划。另一个是阿塞拜疆谴责欧洲委员会议会议员贿赂，以保持沉默，讨论该中亚国家的侵犯人权行为。</ p><p>Yet one by one, more European nations from Ireland to Slovakia are tightening enforcement of anti-graft rules, especially against companies that operate overseas. For years, many governments have turned a blind eye toward bribery of foreign officials on a dubious assumption that their domestic firms might lose business.</p><p>然而，从爱尔兰到斯洛伐克的更多欧洲国家正在逐步加强反贪污规则的执行，特别是针对在海外经营的公司。多年来，许多政府对外国官员的贿赂视而不见，他们怀疑国内公司可能会失去业务。</ p><p>In France, for example, people were shocked in April when a powerful businessman, Vincent Bolloré, was held in jail and questioned over suspected graft in Africa. The move, however, is the result of what is considered a cultural revolution in France. A new law that took effect last year, known as Sapin II, set up a new anti-corruption agency and gives prosecutors new tools to deal with corporate corruption abroad. At least three companies have already settled with the new agency in cases involving bribery of a foreign official.</p>例如，在法国，四月份当一位强大的商人VincentBolloré被关押在监狱并对非洲嫌疑人的嫌疑人提出质疑时，人们感到震惊。然而，此举是法国文化革命的结果。去年生效的一项新法律，即Sapin II，成立了一个新的反腐败机构，并为检察官提供了处理海外公司腐败的新工具。在涉及贿赂外国官员的案件中，至少有三家公司已与新机构达成和解。</ p><p>The new French law is similar to Britain’s Bribery Act of 2010, which itself is based on a ground-breaking law in the US, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977. The US law has been effective in catching many European companies, an embarrassment that has proved an incentive for EU member states to toughen up their own laws. Germany, for example, has cracked down on its firms after the US settled a case with the German engineering firm Siemens in 2008. </p><p>新法国法律类似于2010年英国的“反贿赂法”，该法案本身是基于美国的一项开创性法律，即1977年的“反海外腐败法”。美国法律在捕捉许多欧洲公司方面非常有效，这种尴尬已被证明是欧盟成员国加强自身法律的一种动力。例如，在美国于2008年与德国工程公司西门子达成协议后，德国对其公司进行了打击。</ p><p>With each new anti-graft law in Europe, the US finds it easier to work with European officials on cases of transnational corruption. On both sides of the Atlantic, governments are rising to higher standards of honesty, transparency, and accountability. Together, they may ultimately set a new global standard.</p><p>随着欧洲每一项新的反贪法律，美国发现在跨国腐败案件中与欧洲官员合作更容易。在大西洋两岸，各国政府正在提高诚信度，透明度和问责制的标准。他们可能最终共同制定新的全球标准。</ p><p> </p><P> </ p>','2018-10-28 15:59:05','N'),(364,'https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/A-Christian-Science-Perspective/2018/0524/Charity-begins-at-home','‘Charity begins at home’','<p>In college, I came in contact with <a href=\"http://christianscience.com/what-is-christian-science\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Christian Science</a> teachings for the first time. The idea that we are lovingly cared for by God, who created us as His spiritual offspring, was eye-opening to me. As I better understood these ideas, I witnessed the resolution of all kinds of problems through the power of prayer alone. It was so exciting! And I thought my dad could really benefit from this spiritual view of life. He had been an alcoholic for as long as I could remember. But he mistakenly thought that Christian Science was a cult, and we started to have bitter fights over it.</p><p>在大学期间，我接触了<a href=\"http://christianscience.com/what-is-christian-science\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">基督教科学</a>的教导首次。我们被上帝精心照顾的想法，创造了我们作为他的属灵后代，对我来说是令人大开眼界的。当我更好地理解这些想法时，我亲眼目睹了通过祈祷的力量解决各种问题。太令人兴奋了！而且我认为我的父亲可以从这种精神生活观中受益。只要我记得，他就是酒鬼。但他错误地认为基督教科学是一种邪教，我们开始对它进行激烈的斗争。</ p><p>At one point I realized that if what Christian Science teaches is true, then we are so much more than flawed mortals who are prone to mistakes, because that is not how God has made us. And I saw that my need was not to convince my dad of this but to change my own perspective – to recognize the spiritual reality of his, and everyone’s, real nature. To really understand it.</p><p>有一次，我意识到，如果基督教科学所教导的是真实的，那么我们就不仅仅是容易出错的有瑕疵的凡人，因为这不是上帝创造我们的方式。而且我看到我的需要不是说服我的父亲，而是改变我自己的观点 - 认识到他和每个人的真实本性的精神现实。要真正理解它。</ p><p>There’s a line from “Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,” written by <a href=\"http://christianscience.com/what-is-christian-science/mary-baker-eddy\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mary Baker Eddy</a>, the discoverer of Christian Science, that really speaks to me in this regard. It’s about the Christ, God’s message of love for everyone, that brings reformation and healing to all who are willing to receive it. The line reads in part, “… mortals need only turn from sin and lose sight of mortal selfhood to find Christ, the real man and his relation to God, and to recognize the divine sonship” (<a href=\"https://concordexpress.christianscience.com/?query=SH%20316:3-7\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">p. 316</a>).</p><p>“科学与健康与圣经的关键”中有一句话，由<a href =“http://christianscience.com/what-is-christian-science/mary-baker-eddy”rel =“撰写noopener“target =”_ blank“> Mary Baker Eddy </a>，基督教科学的发现者，在这方面真的对我说话。它是关于基督，上帝对每个人的爱的信息，为所有愿意接受它的人带来改革和医治。这条线部分地写着：“凡人只需要从罪恶中转身，看不到凡人的自我，找到基督，真正的男人和他与上帝的关系，并认识到神圣的儿子”（<a href =“https：// concordexpress.christianscience.com/?query=SH%20316：3-7“rel =”noopener“target =”_ blank“> p.316 </a>。</ p><p>Again, I saw that this wasn’t something I had to persuade my dad to do. It was what I started consciously doing when thinking of my dad: seeing him in the light of these ideas. I started to see a new man, a spiritual and wholly good man, a man whose relation to God had never been broken and could never be broken. Shortly after this he stopped drinking for good, and with that he became more appreciative of Christian Science. Our relationship became even richer.</p><p>再次，我看到这不是我必须说服我父亲去做的事情。这是我在想到我父亲时开始有意识地做的事情：根据这些想法来看他。我开始看到一个新人，一个属灵的，完全善良的人，一个与上帝的关系从未被打破过，永远不会被打破的人。在此之后不久，他停止了喝酒，并因此更加欣赏基督教科学。我们的关系变得更加富裕。</ p><p>There’s an aphorism, “Charity begins at home,” and I think that applies especially to our own thinking. When we strive to see the individual of God’s making, this inevitably helps us and others to experience more of our God-given health and purity. And we find ourselves in possession of life’s finest moments and memories.</p><p>有一句格言，“慈善从家里开始”，我认为这尤其适用于我们自己的想法。当我们努力去看上帝的个体时，这不可避免地帮助我们和其他人更多地体验我们上帝赐予的健康和纯洁。我们发现自己拥有生命中最美好的时刻和回忆。</ p><p><i>Adapted from the May 3, 2018, <a href=\"https://www.christianscience.com/christian-healing-today/daily-lift\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Christian Science Daily Lift podcast</a>.</i></p><p> <i>改编自2018年5月3日，<a href=\"https://www.christianscience.com/christian-healing-today/daily-lift\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">基督教科学每日电梯播客</a>。</ i> </ p>','2018-10-28 15:59:06','N'),(365,'https://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2018/0601/California-to-spend-768-million-toward-cleaning-up-carbon-emission','California to spend $768 million toward cleaning up carbon emission','<p>California utilities will invest nearly $768 million to expand a network of charging stations and build other infrastructure for electric vehicles as the state moves toward a goal of 5 million zero-emission cars on the roads by 2030.</p>加州公用事业公司将投资近7.68亿美元用于扩建充电站网络，并为电动汽车建设其他基础设施，因为该州将在2030年前向道路上实现500万辆零排放汽车的目标。</ p><p>The California Public Utilities Commission voted 5 to 0 Thursday to pay for programs statewide over the next five years, with an emphasis on establishing facilities in disadvantaged communities where traffic and air pollution are often heaviest.</p><p>加州公用事业委员会周四以5比0的投票结果支付全州未来五年的项目费用，重点是在交通和空气污染最严重的贫困社区建立设施。</ p><p>The funding includes $136 million by San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. to provide rebates for as many as 60,000 customers to install home charging stations. </p><p>资金包括圣地亚哥天然气公司的1.36亿美元。电气公司为多达6万名客户提供回扣安装家用充电站。 </ p><p>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric will build 230 direct current fast-charging stations, for a total of nearly $22.5 million.

A long time.” It was “hoydenish.” The word was used because one of the characters is described as “bring[ing] a hoydenish irreverence to the workroom.”</p><p>我正在阅读关于20世纪初哈佛大学女天文学家的戏剧“沉默的天空”的评论，当时我看到一个让我觉得有点像欧比旺克诺比的话：“现在这是我很久没有听到过的一句话。很长一段时间。“这是”兴高采烈。“这个词被使用是因为其中一个角色被描述为”给工作室带来了一种偏执的不敬。“</ p><p><i>Hoydenish</i> is an appropriate word for the play’s time period, as it had its heyday from the mid-19th to the early 20th century. It has mostly outlived its usefulness today, however.  </p><p> <i> Hoydenish </ i>是这个剧本时间段的恰当词汇，因为它从19世纪中叶到20世纪初都有它的鼎盛时期。然而，它今天大部分时间已经过时了。 </ p><p>The word was used to criticize certain sorts of behavior that were once thought objectionable in women but today attract little or no disapproval. A hoyden is a “rude, or ill-bred girl; a boisterous noisy girl,” according to the Oxford English Dictionary. Nowadays, a “boisterous girl” sounds like a fun person to have around at a party, not a worthy target of rebuke.  </p><p>这个词被用来批评曾经被女性认为令人反感的某些行为，但今天很少或根本没有反对。霍登是一个“粗鲁或生病的女孩;一个喧闹吵闹的女孩，“根据牛津英语词典。如今，一个“喧闹的女孩”听起来像是一个有趣的人在聚会上，而不是一个有价值的责备目标。 </ p><p>Rudeness is of course still frowned upon, and sometimes hoydens behaved in ways that are rude by today’s standards – a girl who pushed another out of her seat at school was a hoyden in 1865.  </p><p>当然，粗鲁当然仍然不受欢迎，有时候hoydens表现得像今天的标准一样粗鲁 - 一个女孩在学校推动另一个人离开她的座位是在1865年的一个hoyden。</ p><p>But more often they were tomboys – girls who climbed trees, went barefoot, and spoke their minds freely. They did not conform to the strict rules of Victorian womanhood, with its demands for delicacy, self-control, and deference.  </p><p>但更常见的是他们是男孩们 - 爬树的女孩，赤脚走路，自由地说出自己的想法。他们不符合维多利亚女性的严格规定，要求精致，自我控制和尊重。 </ p><p>So in 1866 we get a Miss Harcourt who “although arrived at the sedate age of sixteen … retained much of the hoydenish, brusque manners for which, alas! she had ever been famed since she could use her feet at all.”  </p><p>因此，在1866年，我们得到了一个哈考特小姐，“虽然到了十六岁的稳重年龄......保留了大部分的狂野，粗暴的举止，唉！因为她可以使用她的脚，所以她一直很有名。“</ p><p>In 1894, older girls were described as “having outgrown the hoydenish period. They are graceful and pretty and well-dressed....” The poem “Holidays,” by Ralph Waldo Emerson, illustrates this opposition: “Whither went the lovely hoyden?/ Disappeared in blessed wife.”</p><p> 1894年，年龄较大的女孩被描述为“已经过时了。他们优雅，漂亮，衣着整洁......“拉尔夫·沃尔多·爱默生的诗”假期“说明了这种反对意见：”可爱的霍伊登去了哪里？/在幸福的妻子身上消失了。“</ p><p>It is hard even to imagine <i>hoyden</i> as a meaningful term of reproach and criticism today. Why shouldn’t girls climb trees? What’s wrong with women laughing loudly and saying what they think?</p><p>今天很难想象<i> hoyden </ i>是一个有意义的责备和批评术语。女孩为什么不爬树？女人大声笑着说出自己的想法有什么不对？</ p><p>And why should a person be obliged to give up that fun and freedom when she ages or if she marries?  </p><p>为什么一个人在她年老或结婚时有义务放弃那种乐趣和自由？ </ p><p>That we view such behaviors so differently today is pleasant, if perhaps minor, evidence of positive social change. The word has lost its charge, and in this case that is a good thing. The astronomers of “Silent Sky” – who spoke their minds, joked loudly with male colleagues, and did scientific work no one expected them to be able to do – were in the hoydenish vanguard.</p><p>我们今天如此看待这种行为是令人愉快的，即使可能是次要的，也是积极的社会变革的证据。这个词已经失去了作用，在这种情况下，这是一件好事。 “沉默的天空”的天文学家 - 他们说出了自己的想法，与男性同事大声开玩笑，做了科学工作，没有人期望他们能够做到 - 是处于骄傲的先锋队。</ p>','2018-10-28 16:00:17','N'),(369,'https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Arts/2018/0518/Top-Picks-Good-Night-Stories-for-Rebel-Girls-podcast-the-Redshift-app-and-more-top-picks','Top Picks: \'Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls\' podcast, the Redshift app, and more top picks','<p><b>Pivotal year</b></p><p> <b>关键年度</ b> </ p><p>Events that occurred in the United States during 1968, from the Tet offensive to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. to the election of President Richard Nixon, had reverberations that are still felt today.

We describe them as “bad,” or, if we’re generous, as “so bad, they’re actually good.” I personally think the example above is just plain good – hilarious and very clever.

They are a subset of a time-honored rhetorical technique, <i>paronomasia</i>, which employs words that resemble each other sometimes for humorous, but more often for serious, effect. The Bible is full of <i>paronomasia</i>. Moses’ name plays on the idea of him being “drawn out” of the river by Pharaoh’s daughter (<i>mosheh</i>, in Hebrew) and being the person who “draws out” (<i>mashah</i>) Israel from bondage in Egypt. Jesus tells his apostle, “you are Peter (Petros), and on this rock (petra) I will build my Church.” These are puns with a purpose; they encourage readers or listeners to engage more deeply with the text.</p><p> Puns利用听起来相似的特定单词或单词的不同含义。它们是历史悠久的修辞技巧的一个子集，<i> paronomasia </ i>，它们使用的词语彼此相似，有时候是幽默的，但更常见的是严肃​​的效果。圣经充满了<i> paronomasia </ i>。摩西的名字意味着他被法老的女儿（<i> mosheh </ i>，希伯来语）“拉出”河流，并成为“抽出”的人（<i> mashah </ i >）以色列在埃及受到奴役。耶稣告诉他的使徒，“你是彼得（彼得罗斯），在这块石头上（佩特拉），我将建造我的教会。”这些是有目的的双关语;他们鼓励读者或听众更深入地参与文本。</ p><p>The Renaissance was the golden age of punning. Shakespeare’s poems and plays contain more than 3,000, from the serious – “Oh, that this too, too solid flesh would melt, thaw, and resolve itself into a dew/ adieu” – to the very bawdy.  </p><p>文艺复兴时期是双关语的黄金时代。莎士比亚的诗歌和戏剧中有超过3000种，其中包括严肃的 - “噢，这太过坚固的肉体会融化，解冻，并将自己融入露水/ ad”中 - 对于那个非常笨拙的人来说。 </ p><p>In the 18th century, though, puns fell from grace. Their multiple meanings were no longer seen as encouraging reflection; rather they were considered a stumbling block to the smooth flow of information. Samuel Johnson hated Shakespeare’s “quibbles,” as he called them, and complained that they continually “checked and blasted” the emotional effect of the plays. Today, puns are “mere” wordplay, possibly funny but never profound.  </p>然而，在18世纪，双关语从恩典中堕落。他们的多重含义不再被视为令人鼓舞的反思;相反，他们被认为是信息畅通的绊脚石。塞缪尔约翰逊憎恨莎士比亚的“狡辩”，并称他们不断“检查并抨击”戏剧的情感效果。今天，双关语是“单纯的”文字游戏，可能有趣但从未深刻。 </ p><p>Because they play with finite sets of word meanings, puns are the one form of joke that computers are consistently able to produce. Some of them are pretty good: “What do you call a beloved mammal? A dear deer.” Some of them aren’t: “What kind of idea melts? A thaw-t.” Certain programs can also evaluate puns, declaring which are funniest.</p><p>因为它们使用有限的单词含义集，所以双关语是计算机始终能够产生的一种笑话形式。其中一些非常好：“你称之为心爱的哺乳动物？亲爱的鹿。“有些人不是：”什么样的想法融化了？解冻。“某些程序也可以评估双关语，宣布哪些是最有趣的。</ p><p>Given that puns are the kind of humor that computers “understand,” perhaps we should rethink our attitude toward them. When the singularity occurs, our robot overlords might keep the punniest among us around.</p><p>鉴于双关语是计算机“理解”的那种幽默，或许我们应该重新思考我们对他们的态度。当奇点出现时，我们的机器人霸主可能会让我们中间最苛刻的人。</ p>','2018-10-28 16:00:23','N'),(372,'https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2018/0608/The-power-of-truth-telling-about-Venezuela','The power of truth-telling about Venezuela','<p>A majority of nations in Latin America took an extraordinary step this week to solve a crisis in Venezuela that is literally spilling across their borders.

In a June 4 ruling, the Supreme Court was so adamant on this point that it didn’t even decide the main issue in a case – whether a Christian baker could refuse to sell a cake for a same-sex couple’s wedding. Instead, the court sided with the baker, Jack Phillips, because anti-religious animus was so clearly an official motive in fining him for discrimination against a customer.</p><p>一个国家享有和平的一种方式是确保政府领导人不要表现出对宗教信仰的恶意。在6月4日的裁决中，最高法院在这一点上非常坚定，它甚至没有决定案件中的主要问题 - 基督徒面包师是否可以拒绝为同性伴侣的婚礼出售蛋糕。相反，法院支持面包师，杰克菲利普斯，因为反宗教的敌意显然是一个官方动机，罚款他歧视客户。</ p><p>The ruling leaves to another day the question of how to balance a business person’s religious objections to supporting gay marriage against the rights of gays to wed without facing bias from a commercial operation. For now, the court wanted to send a warning that government must be neutral toward religious beliefs in deciding how it acts against the practices of religious believers.</p><p>这项裁决还有一个问题，即如何在不面对商业运作偏见的情况下，平衡商务人士支持同性婚姻的宗教异议与同性恋者的权利。目前，法院希望发出一个警告，即政府必须对宗教信仰保持中立，以决定它如何反对宗教信徒的做法。</ p><p>The 7-to-2 ruling focused on the open hostility of some members of Colorado’s civil rights commission toward Mr. Phillips’s Christian views in ruling against him. The court also pointed out the commission’s double standard in not fining three other bakers who had refused to sell cakes with anti-gay themes.</p><p> 7比2的裁决集中在科罗拉多州民权委员会的一些成员对菲利普斯的基督教观点对他的裁决中的公开敌意。法院还指出该委员会的双重标准是不对另外三名拒绝出售反同性恋主题蛋糕的面包师进行罚款。</ p><p>“It hardly requires restating that government has no role in deciding or even suggesting whether the religious ground for Phillips’ conscience-based objection is legitimate or illegitimate,” Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the majority. The law protects against discrimination on the basis of religion as well as sexual orientation, he added.</p>“几乎没有必要重申，政府在决定甚至暗示菲利普斯基于良心的异议的宗教理由是否合法或非法时，没有任何作用，”安东尼肯尼迪大法官为大多数人写道。他补充说，法律保护不受基于宗教和性取向的歧视。</ p><p>Courts have long looked at the motives of lawmakers and regulators in its decisions. In particular, government actions born of animosity toward the views of a religious minority violate the Constitution’s clauses that allow the free exercise of religion and prohibit the government establishment of religion. From the Republic’s early days, the Founders sought to prevent the kind of violent social conflicts over religious beliefs that had ripped apart Europe for centuries.</p><p>法院长期以来一直关注立法者和监管者在其决策中的动机。特别是，由于对宗教少数群体的观点的敌意而产生的政府行为违反了宪法的条款，允许自由行使宗教并禁止政府建立宗教。从共和国的早期开始，创始人试图防止那些在几个世纪以来破坏欧洲宗教信仰的暴力社会冲突。</ p><p>Justice Kennedy also sent a reminder of the qualities needed in government to keep social harmony. The Colorado commission, he wrote, “was neither tolerant nor respectful of Phillips’ religious beliefs.”</p><p>肯尼迪大法官还提醒了政府保持社会和谐所需的素质。他写道，科罗拉多州委员会“既不宽容也不尊重菲利普斯的宗教信仰。”</ p><p>With the immense power of government to fine or to jail people, lawmakers and regulators must indeed embrace such civic affections and be fair in their actions involving religion.

Nowadays, a “boisterous girl” sounds like a fun person to have around at a party, not a worthy target of rebuke.  </p><p>这个词被用来批评曾经被女性认为令人反感的某些行为，但今天很少或根本没有反对。霍登是一个“粗鲁或生病的女孩;一个喧闹吵闹的女孩，“根据牛津英语词典。如今，一个“喧闹的女孩”听起来像是一个有趣的人在聚会上，而不是一个有价值的责备目标。 </ p><p>Rudeness is of course still frowned upon, and sometimes hoydens behaved in ways that are rude by today’s standards – a girl who pushed another out of her seat at school was a hoyden in 1865.  </p><p>当然，粗鲁当然仍然不受欢迎，有时候hoydens表现得像今天的标准一样粗鲁 - 一个女孩在学校推动另一个人离开她的座位是在1865年的一个hoyden。</ p><p>But more often they were tomboys – girls who climbed trees, went barefoot, and spoke their minds freely. They did not conform to the strict rules of Victorian womanhood, with its demands for delicacy, self-control, and deference.  </p><p>但更常见的是他们是男孩们 - 爬树的女孩，赤脚走路，自由地说出自己的想法。他们不符合维多利亚女性的严格规定，要求精致，自我控制和尊重。 </ p><p>So in 1866 we get a Miss Harcourt who “although arrived at the sedate age of sixteen … retained much of the hoydenish, brusque manners for which, alas! she had ever been famed since she could use her feet at all.”  </p><p>因此，在1866年，我们得到了一个哈考特小姐，“虽然到了十六岁的稳重年龄......保留了大部分的狂野，粗暴的举止，唉！因为她可以使用她的脚，所以她一直很有名。“</ p><p>In 1894, older girls were described as “having outgrown the hoydenish period. They are graceful and pretty and well-dressed....” The poem “Holidays,” by Ralph Waldo Emerson, illustrates this opposition: “Whither went the lovely hoyden?/ Disappeared in blessed wife.”</p><p> 1894年，年龄较大的女孩被描述为“已经过时了。他们优雅，漂亮，衣着整洁......“拉尔夫·沃尔多·爱默生的诗”假期“说明了这种反对意见：”可爱的霍伊登去了哪里？/在幸福的妻子身上消失了。“</ p><p>It is hard even to imagine <i>hoyden</i> as a meaningful term of reproach and criticism today. Why shouldn’t girls climb trees? What’s wrong with women laughing loudly and saying what they think?</p><p>今天很难想象<i> hoyden </ i>是一个有意义的责备和批评术语。女孩为什么不爬树？女人大声笑着说出自己的想法有什么不对？</ p><p>And why should a person be obliged to give up that fun and freedom when she ages or if she marries?  </p><p>为什么一个人在她年老或结婚时有义务放弃那种乐趣和自由？ </ p><p>That we view such behaviors so differently today is pleasant, if perhaps minor, evidence of positive social change. The word has lost its charge, and in this case that is a good thing. The astronomers of “Silent Sky” – who spoke their minds, joked loudly with male colleagues, and did scientific work no one expected them to be able to do – were in the hoydenish vanguard.</p><p>我们今天如此看待这种行为是令人愉快的，即使可能是次要的，也是积极的社会变革的证据。这个词已经失去了作用，在这种情况下，这是一件好事。 “沉默的天空”的天文学家 - 他们说出了自己的想法，与男性同事大声开玩笑，做了科学工作，没有人期望他们能够做到 - 是处于骄傲的先锋队。</ p>','2018-10-28 16:02:49','N'),(381,'https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2018/0530/Efforts-to-protect-Afghan-women-are-failing-UN-reports','Efforts to protect Afghan women are failing, UN reports','<p>A law meant to protect Afghan women from violence is being undermined by authorities who routinely refer even serious criminal cases to traditional mediation councils that fail to protect victims, the United Nations said on Tuesday.</p><p>联合国周二表示，一项旨在保护阿富汗妇女免受暴力侵害的法律正受到当局的破坏，他们甚至将严重的刑事案件直接提交给未能保护受害者的传统调解委员会。</ p><p>The Elimination of Violence against Women (EVAW) law, passed in 2009, was a centerpiece of efforts to improve protection for Afghan women, who suffer widespread violence in one of the worst countries in the world to be born female.</p><p> 2009年通过的“消除暴力侵害妇女行为法”（EVAW）成为改善对阿富汗妇女保护的努力的核心，这些妇女在世界上最贫穷的国家中遭受了广泛的暴力，无法生下女性。</ p><p>But its effectiveness has been weakened by continued reliance on mediation by local elders to resolve violent crime.</p><p>但是，由于当地老年人继续依赖调解来解决暴力犯罪，其效力已被削弱。</ p><p>\"The wide use of mediation when a woman or girl has been beaten, mutilated, or murdered, or when she has been the victim of that awful concept of \'honor killing\', normalizes such violence and makes it much more likely to recur,\" said Zeid Ra\'ad Al Hussein, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>“当一个女人或女孩遭到殴打，肢解或谋杀，或者当她成为那种可怕的”荣誉杀戮“概念的受害者时，广泛使用调解，使这种暴力正常化并使其更有可能“联合国人权事务高级专员扎伊德·拉阿德·侯赛因说。”<p>\"To use mediation for such offenses is at its core a human rights violation by the State,\" Mr. Al Hussein said in a statement accompanying a United Nations report, entitled \"Injustice and Impunity: Mediation of Criminal Offences against Women.\"</p>“对于此类犯罪使用调解的核心是国家侵犯人权，”Al Hussein先生在联合国题为“不公正和有罪不罚：对妇女的刑事犯罪的调解”的报告中说。 “</ p><p>In many remote parts of Afghanistan, where the formal legal system has no sway, mediation is the only form of justice, but the UN report focused on cases reported to the authorities.</p><p>在阿富汗的许多偏远地区，正式的法律体系不受影响，调解是唯一的司法形式，但联合国报告侧重于向当局报告的案件。</ p><p>No comment was immediately available from the office of Afghanistan\'s attorney general.</p><p>阿富汗司法部长办公室没有立即发表评论。</ p><p>Improving the situation of women in Afghanistan has been a priority for Western donors, who have pumped billions of dollars into the country.</p><p>改善阿富汗妇女的状况一直是西方捐助者的优先事项，他们向该国投入了数十亿美元。</ p><p>But more than 17 years after the overthrow of the Taliban, the report underlines the still-dire situation facing many women in Afghanistan, which ranks near the bottom of the United Nations Development Programme\'s Gender Inequality Index.</p><p>但在推翻塔利班已有17年多的时间，该报告强调了阿富汗许多妇女面临的仍然严峻形势，这一情况接近联合国开发计划署性别不平等指数的最低点。</ p><p>Tuesday\'s report was based on 237 cases of violence against women and 280 cases of murder in 2016 and 2017, including murders within families sometimes called \"honor killings.\"</p><p>周二的报告基于2016年和2017年237起暴力侵害妇女案件和280起谋杀案件，其中包括有时被称为“名誉杀人”的家庭谋杀案。</ p><p>It found such crimes appeared to enjoy \"de facto immunity,\" fostered by a reliance on mediation, with just 18 percent of cases ending in conviction and a prison sentence.</p><p>它发现此类罪行似乎享有“事实上的豁免权”，这是由于依赖调解而导致的，只有18％的案件以定罪和监禁判决结束。</ p><p>\"The resolution of such cases by mediation must never occur; and cases should be prosecuted under the applicable general murder articles in order to end impunity,\" it said.</p>“通过调解解决此类案件绝不应该发生;案件应根据适用的一般谋杀条款起诉，以结束有罪不罚现象，”它说。</ p><p>The report highlighted problems successive Afghan governments have had in building a functioning judicial system in a country that has traditionally relied heavily on religious leaders or elders to settle disputes.</p><p>该报告强调了阿富汗政府在一个传统上严重依赖宗教领袖或长老来解决争端的国家建立一个有效的司法系统所遇到的问题。</ p><p>It said many women faced pressure from family members and even some legal groups set up under the EVAW law to withdraw complaints or accept mediation.

In a June 4 ruling, the Supreme Court was so adamant on this point that it didn’t even decide the main issue in a case – whether a Christian baker could refuse to sell a cake for a same-sex couple’s wedding. Instead, the court sided with the baker, Jack Phillips, because anti-religious animus was so clearly an official motive in fining him for discrimination against a customer.</p><p>一个国家享有和平的一种方式是确保政府领导人不要表现出对宗教信仰的恶意。在6月4日的裁决中，最高法院在这一点上非常坚定，它甚至没有决定案件中的主要问题 - 基督徒面包师是否可以拒绝为同性伴侣的婚礼出售蛋糕。相反，法院支持面包师，杰克菲利普斯，因为反宗教的敌意显然是一个官方动机，罚款他歧视客户。</ p><p>The ruling leaves to another day the question of how to balance a business person’s religious objections to supporting gay marriage against the rights of gays to wed without facing bias from a commercial operation. For now, the court wanted to send a warning that government must be neutral toward religious beliefs in deciding how it acts against the practices of religious believers.</p><p>这项裁决还有一个问题，即如何在不面对商业运作偏见的情况下，平衡商务人士支持同性婚姻的宗教异议与同性恋者的权利。目前，法院希望发出一个警告，即政府必须对宗教信仰保持中立，以决定它如何反对宗教信徒的做法。</ p><p>The 7-to-2 ruling focused on the open hostility of some members of Colorado’s civil rights commission toward Mr. Phillips’s Christian views in ruling against him. The court also pointed out the commission’s double standard in not fining three other bakers who had refused to sell cakes with anti-gay themes.</p><p> 7比2的裁决集中在科罗拉多州民权委员会的一些成员对菲利普斯的基督教观点对他的裁决中的公开敌意。法院还指出该委员会的双重标准是不对另外三名拒绝出售反同性恋主题蛋糕的面包师进行罚款。</ p><p>“It hardly requires restating that government has no role in deciding or even suggesting whether the religious ground for Phillips’ conscience-based objection is legitimate or illegitimate,” Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the majority. The law protects against discrimination on the basis of religion as well as sexual orientation, he added.</p>“几乎没有必要重申，政府在决定甚至暗示菲利普斯基于良心的异议的宗教理由是否合法或非法时，没有任何作用，”安东尼肯尼迪大法官为大多数人写道。他补充说，法律保护不受基于宗教和性取向的歧视。</ p><p>Courts have long looked at the motives of lawmakers and regulators in its decisions. In particular, government actions born of animosity toward the views of a religious minority violate the Constitution’s clauses that allow the free exercise of religion and prohibit the government establishment of religion. From the Republic’s early days, the Founders sought to prevent the kind of violent social conflicts over religious beliefs that had ripped apart Europe for centuries.</p><p>法院长期以来一直关注立法者和监管者在其决策中的动机。特别是，由于对宗教少数群体的观点的敌意而产生的政府行为违反了宪法的条款，允许自由行使宗教并禁止政府建立宗教。从共和国的早期开始，创始人试图防止那些在几个世纪以来破坏欧洲宗教信仰的暴力社会冲突。</ p><p>Justice Kennedy also sent a reminder of the qualities needed in government to keep social harmony. The Colorado commission, he wrote, “was neither tolerant nor respectful of Phillips’ religious beliefs.”</p><p>肯尼迪大法官还提醒了政府保持社会和谐所需的素质。他写道，科罗拉多州委员会“既不宽容也不尊重菲利普斯的宗教信仰。”</ p><p>With the immense power of government to fine or to jail people, lawmakers and regulators must indeed embrace such civic affections and be fair in their actions involving religion. Motives do matter as much as the law.</p><p>由于政府有巨大的权力来罚款或监禁人民，立法者和监管者必须真正接受这种公民情感，并在涉及宗教的行为中公平。动机与法律一样重要。</ p>','2018-10-28 16:04:34','N');

I decided that the subject pronouns “you and I” must be right, because they parallel “Albert and his date,” the subjects of the sentence. Actually, the correct answer is “you and me.” Because the pronouns are objects of a preposition (“instead of”), they must be in the objective (me, him, her, us, etc.) case. I had hypercorrected and gotten it wrong.</p><p>我的女儿正在学习语法测试并向我征求意见：以下句子是否正确？ “而不是你和我，今年艾伯特和他的约会将负责野餐的计划。”我的直觉是拒绝，它应该是“而不是你和我。”但后来我想到了上下文，我的女儿学习狡猾的语法，考试 - 当然它必须更复杂。我决定主语代词“你和我”必须是对的，因为它们与“阿尔伯特和他的约会”并列句子的主语。实际上，正确的答案是“你和我。”因为代词是介词（“而不是”）的对象，所以它们必须是客观的（我，他，她，我们等）。我纠错了，弄错了。</ p><p>Hypercorrection happens when a person overapplies the rules of grammar, spelling, or pronunciation. Young children generally develop an excellent sense of what sorts of constructions are “right” in their native language. Hypercorrection tends to occur in two circumstances: when speakers of a dialect, who have internalized slightly different rules, employ the “standard” language, and when people use what linguists call “prestige constructions,” the sort of grammar learned in school but rarely encountered in everyday life. The cockney dialect of London, for example, drops “H’s” (Eliza Doolittle’s “ ’ampshire” and  “ ’urricane”). Cockney speakers know there is a “pronounce H’s” rule in standard English but sometimes overapply it, saying “h-ouse” and “H-ampshire,” but also “h-eir” and “h-onor.” </p><p>当一个人超出语法，拼写或发音规则时，就会发生超校正。幼儿通常对他们的母语中哪种结构“正确”有很好的认识。超纠现象往往发生在两种情况下：当方言的说话者，内化了略微不同的规则时，使用“标准”语言，当人们使用语言学家所谓的“声望建构”时，这种语法在学校学到但很少遇到在日常生活中。例如，伦敦的方言方言就是“H”（伊丽莎·杜利特尔的“安普尔”和“尿”）。 Cockney发言者知道标准英语中有一个“发音H”规则，但有时会过度使用它，说“h-ouse”和“H-ampshire”，还有“h-eir”和“h-onor”。</ p><p>My difficulties with my daughter’s question are an example of confusion over a prestige construction. Though in many dialects of English it is normal to say “Him and me went to the grocery store,” most of us know that in standard English, we say “He and I.” We extrapolate from this that the subject form of these pronouns is somehow more formal, and more “correct” all the time, which leads us to favor them when we are pushed out of our linguistic comfort zone. </p><p>我对女儿问题的困难是对声望建构的困惑的一个例子。虽然在许多英语方言中说“他和我去杂货店”是正常的，但我们大多数人都知道，在标准英语中，我们说“他和我”。我们从这里推断出这些代词的主语形式在某种程度上更正式，更“正确”，当我们被推出语言舒适区时，这会使我们偏向它们。 </ p><p>As the term “prestige construction” hints, hypercorrection is intimately bound up with issues of social class. Easy mastery of this sort of grammar seems to show that you are an educated person. Many people thus don’t look kindly on hypercorrection, assuming it reveals that you are trying to be something you are not. Anthropologist William O’Barr has studied this phenomenon in the language of trial witnesses and found that those who did a lot of it were thought to be less “convincing” and “competent.” </p><p>正如“声望建构”一词暗示的那样，过度矫正与社会阶层问题密切相关。轻松掌握这种语法似乎表明你是一个受过教育的人。因此，许多人看起来并不善待过度矫正，假设它表明你正试图成为你不是的东西。人类学家威廉·奥巴尔用试验证人的语言研究了这一现象，并发现那些做过很多事情的人被认为不那么“有说服力”和“能干”。</ p><p>Between you and me – or as Shakespeare says, “between you and I” – I think we should be charitable when people hypercorrect.</p><p>在你我之间 - 或者正如莎士比亚所说的那样，“在你我之间” - 我认为当人们过于矫正时，我们应该是慈善事业。</ p>','2018-10-28 16:08:03','N'),(403,'https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/TV/2018/0601/What-are-you-watching-Readers-recommend-Big-Little-Lies-The-Americans','What are you watching?

George Washington was apparently the first person to give a <i>stump speech</i>. A satirical ballad from 1775 describes how “Upon a stump, he placed himself,... and ... Proclaimed great Liberty.”  </p>相比之下，美国政客在任何地方都更加非正式和言论化，即使是在树桩上 - 因此，<i>在树桩上</ i>。乔治华盛顿显然是第一个发表<i>残余演讲的人</ i>。 1775年的讽刺民谣描述了“在一个残骸，他放置自己，......并......宣布伟大的自由。”</ p><p><i>On the hustings</i> and <i>on the stump</i> mean the same thing today: giving speeches and trying to get votes. </p><p> <i> on the hustings </ i>和<i> on the stump </ i>今天意味着同样的事情：发表演讲并试图获得投票。 </ p><p>Perhaps because hustings were fairly high off the ground, British politicians today tend to <i>stand for</i> <i>election</i>, while Americans, moving from stump to stump, <i>run for office</i>.

The word was first used in English, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, to indicate the time an army was fighting “in the field.” By the 19th century, <i>campaign</i> was used to describe efforts in support of causes (“the campaign for women’s suffrage”) and politicians’ attempts to get elected. </p><p>大西洋两岸的政治家组织<i>活动</ i>，源自法国<i> campagne </ i>（“乡村”）。根据牛津英语词典，这个词最初是用英语表示的，表明军队在“战场上”打架的时间。到了19世纪，<i>战役</ i>被用来描述支持原因（“妇女选举权运动”）和政客们试图当选。 </ p><p><i>Candidate</i> and <i>candid</i> (“truthful, frank”) share the same root, which is easy to see orthographically but perhaps harder to believe.

Canvassing generally involves going door to door to gauge or solicit support for a candidate, but it comes from <i>cannabis</i>, the Latin word for, well, cannabis. Romans used the plant in various medicines and made rope and cloth (<i>canvas</i>) from its fibers. The English verb <i>to canvass </i>originally meant “to toss in a canvas sheet, as a sport or punishment,” then, physically, “to shake and shatter thoroughly ... to beat.”  </p>然而，<p> <i> Canvass </ i>必须是具有最奇怪的词源的竞选词。拉票通常涉及挨家挨户地测量或征求对候选人的支持，但它来自<i> cannabis </ i>，拉丁语中的，大麻，大麻。罗马人将这种植物用于各种药物中，并用纤维制成绳索和布料（<i>帆布</ i>）。英语动词<i> to canvass </ i>最初的意思是“投入画布表，作为运动或惩罚”，然后，身体上，“彻底震动和破碎......击败。”</ p><p>During the Renaissance, “I will canvass you” was thus not a request for your opinion, but a promise to thrash you. Eventually the word was used more figuratively – to canvass an issue was to break it apart, scrutinize, and talk through it. </p><p>在文艺复兴时期，“我会拉扯你”因此不是对你的意见的要求，而是对你的抨击的承诺。最终这个词用得更具象征性 - 探讨一个问题就是将它分开，仔细检查，并通过它进行讨论。 </ p><p>There are so many wonderful campaign words, I feel as if I could go on forever – just like campaign season.</p><p>有很多精彩的竞选单词，我觉得我可以永远继续下去 - 就像竞选季节一样。</ p>','2018-10-28 16:10:06','N'),(408,'https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/TV/2018/0611/What-are-you-watching-Readers-recommend-Deutschland-83-Heartland','What are you watching?

I decided that the subject pronouns “you and I” must be right, because they parallel “Albert and his date,” the subjects of the sentence. Actually, the correct answer is “you and me.” Because the pronouns are objects of a preposition (“instead of”), they must be in the objective (me, him, her, us, etc.) case. I had hypercorrected and gotten it wrong.</p><p>我的女儿正在学习语法测试并向我征求意见：以下句子是否正确？ “而不是你和我，今年艾伯特和他的约会将负责野餐的计划。”我的直觉是拒绝，它应该是“而不是你和我。”但后来我想到了上下文，我的女儿学习狡猾的语法，考试 - 当然它必须更复杂。我决定主语代词“你和我”必须是对的，因为它们与“阿尔伯特和他的约会”并列句子的主语。实际上，正确的答案是“你和我。”因为代词是介词（“而不是”）的对象，所以它们必须是客观的（我，他，她，我们等）。我纠错了，弄错了。</ p><p>Hypercorrection happens when a person overapplies the rules of grammar, spelling, or pronunciation. Young children generally develop an excellent sense of what sorts of constructions are “right” in their native language. Hypercorrection tends to occur in two circumstances: when speakers of a dialect, who have internalized slightly different rules, employ the “standard” language, and when people use what linguists call “prestige constructions,” the sort of grammar learned in school but rarely encountered in everyday life. The cockney dialect of London, for example, drops “H’s” (Eliza Doolittle’s “ ’ampshire” and  “ ’urricane”). Cockney speakers know there is a “pronounce H’s” rule in standard English but sometimes overapply it, saying “h-ouse” and “H-ampshire,” but also “h-eir” and “h-onor.” </p><p>当一个人超出语法，拼写或发音规则时，就会发生超校正。幼儿通常对他们的母语中哪种结构“正确”有很好的认识。超纠现象往往发生在两种情况下：当方言的说话者，内化了略微不同的规则时，使用“标准”语言，当人们使用语言学家所谓的“声望建构”时，这种语法在学校学到但很少遇到在日常生活中。例如，伦敦的方言方言就是“H”（伊丽莎·杜利特尔的“安普尔”和“尿”）。 Cockney发言者知道标准英语中有一个“发音H”规则，但有时会过度使用它，说“h-ouse”和“H-ampshire”，还有“h-eir”和“h-onor”。</ p><p>My difficulties with my daughter’s question are an example of confusion over a prestige construction. Though in many dialects of English it is normal to say “Him and me went to the grocery store,” most of us know that in standard English, we say “He and I.” We extrapolate from this that the subject form of these pronouns is somehow more formal, and more “correct” all the time, which leads us to favor them when we are pushed out of our linguistic comfort zone. </p><p>我对女儿问题的困难是对声望建构的困惑的一个例子。虽然在许多英语方言中说“他和我去杂货店”是正常的，但我们大多数人都知道，在标准英语中，我们说“他和我”。我们从这里推断出这些代词的主语形式在某种程度上更正式，更“正确”，当我们被推出语言舒适区时，这会使我们偏向它们。 </ p><p>As the term “prestige construction” hints, hypercorrection is intimately bound up with issues of social class. Easy mastery of this sort of grammar seems to show that you are an educated person. Many people thus don’t look kindly on hypercorrection, assuming it reveals that you are trying to be something you are not. Anthropologist William O’Barr has studied this phenomenon in the language of trial witnesses and found that those who did a lot of it were thought to be less “convincing” and “competent.” </p><p>正如“声望建构”一词暗示的那样，过度矫正与社会阶层问题密切相关。轻松掌握这种语法似乎表明你是一个受过教育的人。因此，许多人看起来并不善待过度矫正，假设它表明你正试图成为你不是的东西。人类学家威廉·奥巴尔用试验证人的语言研究了这一现象，并发现那些做过很多事情的人被认为不那么“有说服力”和“能干”。</ p><p>Between you and me – or as Shakespeare says, “between you and I” – I think we should be charitable when people hypercorrect.</p><p>在你我之间 - 或者正如莎士比亚所说的那样，“在你我之间” - 我认为当人们过于矫正时，我们应该是慈善事业。</ p>','2018-10-28 16:10:28','N'),(413,'https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2018/0531/Illinois-becomes-37th-state-to-ratify-Equal-Rights-Amendment','Illinois becomes 37th state to ratify Equal Rights Amendment','<p>Illinois on Wednesday became the 37th state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), putting the country only one state away from a landmark change to the United States Constitution guaranteeing equal rights for women.</p>伊利诺伊州周三成为批准平等权利修正案（ERA）的第37个州，使该国只有一个国家远离美国宪法的一项具有里程碑意义的改变，保障妇女的平等权利。</ p><p>The historic passage was nearly half a century in the making, and came 38 years after supporters staged hunger strikes and floor sit-ins in a futile attempt to persuade the Illinois Legislature to OK the proposal by what was a congressionally set deadline.</p>这段历史性的文章正在制作中近半个世纪，并且在支持者进行绝食抗议和地板静坐之后38年，他们徒劳地试图说服伊利诺伊州议会在国会设定的截止日期前提出建议。 </ p><p>The Illinois House approved the amendment 72 to 45 Wednesday.

I decided that the subject pronouns “you and I” must be right, because they parallel “Albert and his date,” the subjects of the sentence. Actually, the correct answer is “you and me.” Because the pronouns are objects of a preposition (“instead of”), they must be in the objective (me, him, her, us, etc.) case. I had hypercorrected and gotten it wrong.</p><p>我的女儿正在学习语法测试并向我征求意见：以下句子是否正确？ “而不是你和我，今年艾伯特和他的约会将负责野餐的计划。”我的直觉是拒绝，它应该是“而不是你和我。”但后来我想到了上下文，我的女儿学习狡猾的语法，考试 - 当然它必须更复杂。我决定主语代词“你和我”必须是对的，因为它们与“阿尔伯特和他的约会”并列句子的主语。实际上，正确的答案是“你和我。”因为代词是介词（“而不是”）的对象，所以它们必须是客观的（我，他，她，我们等）。我纠错了，弄错了。</ p><p>Hypercorrection happens when a person overapplies the rules of grammar, spelling, or pronunciation. Young children generally develop an excellent sense of what sorts of constructions are “right” in their native language. Hypercorrection tends to occur in two circumstances: when speakers of a dialect, who have internalized slightly different rules, employ the “standard” language, and when people use what linguists call “prestige constructions,” the sort of grammar learned in school but rarely encountered in everyday life. The cockney dialect of London, for example, drops “H’s” (Eliza Doolittle’s “ ’ampshire” and  “ ’urricane”). Cockney speakers know there is a “pronounce H’s” rule in standard English but sometimes overapply it, saying “h-ouse” and “H-ampshire,” but also “h-eir” and “h-onor.” </p><p>当一个人超出语法，拼写或发音规则时，就会发生超校正。幼儿通常对他们的母语中哪种结构“正确”有很好的认识。超纠现象往往发生在两种情况下：当方言的说话者，内化了略微不同的规则时，使用“标准”语言，当人们使用语言学家所谓的“声望建构”时，这种语法在学校学到但很少遇到在日常生活中。例如，伦敦的方言方言就是“H”（伊丽莎·杜利特尔的“安普尔”和“尿”）。 Cockney发言者知道标准英语中有一个“发音H”规则，但有时会过度使用它，说“h-ouse”和“H-ampshire”，还有“h-eir”和“h-onor”。</ p><p>My difficulties with my daughter’s question are an example of confusion over a prestige construction. Though in many dialects of English it is normal to say “Him and me went to the grocery store,” most of us know that in standard English, we say “He and I.” We extrapolate from this that the subject form of these pronouns is somehow more formal, and more “correct” all the time, which leads us to favor them when we are pushed out of our linguistic comfort zone. </p><p>我对女儿问题的困难是对声望建构的困惑的一个例子。虽然在许多英语方言中说“他和我去杂货店”是正常的，但我们大多数人都知道，在标准英语中，我们说“他和我”。我们从这里推断出这些代词的主语形式在某种程度上更正式，更“正确”，当我们被推出语言舒适区时，这会使我们偏向它们。 </ p><p>As the term “prestige construction” hints, hypercorrection is intimately bound up with issues of social class. Easy mastery of this sort of grammar seems to show that you are an educated person. Many people thus don’t look kindly on hypercorrection, assuming it reveals that you are trying to be something you are not. Anthropologist William O’Barr has studied this phenomenon in the language of trial witnesses and found that those who did a lot of it were thought to be less “convincing” and “competent.” </p><p>正如“声望建构”一词暗示的那样，过度矫正与社会阶层问题密切相关。轻松掌握这种语法似乎表明你是一个受过教育的人。因此，许多人看起来并不善待过度矫正，假设它表明你正试图成为你不是的东西。人类学家威廉·奥巴尔用试验证人的语言研究了这一现象，并发现那些做过很多事情的人被认为不那么“有说服力”和“能干”。</ p><p>Between you and me – or as Shakespeare says, “between you and I” – I think we should be charitable when people hypercorrect.</p><p>在你我之间 - 或者正如莎士比亚所说的那样，“在你我之间” - 我认为当人们过于矫正时，我们应该是慈善事业。</ p>','2018-10-28 16:12:51','N'),(426,'https://www.csmonitor.com/World/2018/0619/Record-68.5-million-people-displaced-in-2017-UN-reports','Record 68.5 million people displaced in 2017, UN reports','<p>The United Nations refugee agency reported Tuesday that nearly 69 million people who have fled war, violence, and persecution were forcibly displaced last year, a record for the fifth straight year.</p><p>联合国难民署周二报道，去年有近6900万逃离战争，暴力和迫害的人被强迫流离失所，这是连续第五年创下纪录。</ p><p>The UN High Commissioner for Refugees said the continued crises in places such as South Sudan and Congo, as well as the exodus of Muslim Rohingya from Myanmar that started last year, raised the overall figure of forced displacements in 2017 to 68.5 million.</p><p>联合国难民事务高级专员表示，南苏丹和刚果等地继续发生的危机，以及去年开始的缅甸穆斯林罗兴亚人的外流，使2017年被迫流离失所的总人数增加到6,850万。 </ p><p>Of that total, 16.2 million were newly displaced last year – an average of more than 44,000 people per day.

As members of the Senate arm themselves for a battle royal over President Trump’s nomination, they may want to build on, rather than ignore, his judicial legacy.</p><p>安东尼肯尼迪大法官在美国最高法院三十年后退休后留下的一个遗产，就如何就选择他的继任者进行有尊严的辩论提供了一些原则指导。正如参议院议员为特朗普总统提名的王室争夺战，他们可能希望继续而不是忽视他的司法遗产。</ p><p>When he wrote the court’s official opinions, Justice Kennedy often sought a path for many of those who lost their legal case to see their views expressed in policy. This went far beyond his strong defense of free speech. Governance to him was not a zero-sum choice between the demands of the left and the right but rather a search to define what he called “transcendent” attributes and the “spiritual imperatives” necessary for a complex world.</p><p>当他撰写法院的官方意见时，肯尼迪大法官经常为许多失去法律案件的人寻求一条道路，以便看到他们在政策中表达的观点。这远远超出了他对言论自由的强烈捍卫。对他的治理不是左派和右派要求之间的零和选择，而是寻求定义他所谓的“超越”属性和复杂世界所必需的“精神命令”。</ p><p>Before Elena Kagan joined the high court as a justice, she described Kennedy as its most influential member because of his “independence, his integrity, his unique and evolving vision.” In many of the court’s biggest decisions, he was the swing vote, and for good reason. He sought to interpret the Constitution in ways that could ensure that the inner conscience of individuals and their outward responsibilities were not in conflict.</p><p>在Elena Kagan作为一名司法官加入高等法院之前，她将肯尼迪描述为其最具影响力的成员，因为他的“独立，他的正直，他独特和不断发展的愿景。”在法院的许多最大决定中，他是摇摆不定的投票，并有充分理由。他试图以能够确保个人的内心良知及其外在责任不会发生冲突的方式来解释宪法。</ p><p>To achieve that, he relied heavily on the basic principles of liberty, privacy, and universal equality, then mixed all three to emphasize the intrinsic value of dignity.</p><p>为实现这一目标，他严重依赖自由，隐私和普遍平等的基本原则，然后将这三者融为一体，强调尊严的内在价值。</ p><p>In Kennedy’s focus on dignity – either to preserve it or bestow it – he saw the makings of social cohesion and healing. Or as he put it in a talk, “Most people know in their innermost being that they have dignity and that this imposes upon others the duty of respect.”</p><p>在肯尼迪关注尊严 - 无论是为了保护还是赋予它 - 他都看到了社会凝聚力和医治的气质。或者正如他在谈话中所说的那样，“大多数人都知道他们内心深处认为他们有尊严，并且这会给他人带来尊重的责任。”</ p><p>Such thinking was usually evident, if not always accepted, in his most important rulings, such as those on campaign finance, same-sex marriage, religious exercise, and the rights of detainees at Guantánamo Bay. In many cases, he saw the best course to ensure the continuance of dignity was to set boundaries on government power. In others, he saw such power as necessary to end any harm to dignity.</p><p>这种想法在他最重要的裁决中通常是明显的，如果不是总是被接受的，例如关于竞选财务，同性婚姻，宗教活动以及关塔那摩湾被拘留者权利的裁决。在许多情况下，他认为确保尊严持续的最佳方法是为政府权力设定界限。在其他人看来，他看到了必要的权力，以结束对尊严的任何伤害。</ p><p>Dignity is not something defined from the outside. Each individual is endowed with it. Guarding it in the way Kennedy did can help engender respect for the dignity of others.</p><p>尊严不是外界定义的。每个人都被赋予它。以肯尼迪所做的方式保护它可以帮助培养对他人尊严的尊重。</ p><p>Dignity is not a source for division but, if recognized, can be the basis for what Kennedy calls the best interpretation of the “mandates and promises” of the Constitution. “I am searching, as I think many judges are, for the correct balance in constitutional interpretation,” Kennedy stated.</p><p>尊严不是分裂的来源，但如果得到承认，可以成为肯尼迪所谓的对宪法“任务和承诺”的最佳解释的基础。肯尼迪说：“我正在寻找，因为我认为很多法官都是在宪法解释中保持正确的平衡。”</ p><p>Dignity was his lodestar. And perhaps it can also be the starting point for the coming national discussion over his replacement.</p><p>尊严是他的梦想家。也许它也可能成为即将到来的全国性讨论的起点。</ p>','2018-10-28 16:14:06','N'),(428,'https://www.csmonitor.com/Business/2018/0606/Adding-more-women-to-workforce-could-extend-bull-market-study-finds','Adding more women to workforce could extend bull market, study finds','<p>The secret to unlocking a further $6 trillion of gains in global stocks and adding another 10 years to this bull run?

This word was coined in the 1950s to give a name to “the statistical analysis of trends in voting,” but what psephologists really seem to enjoy is forecasting the results of upcoming elections. <i>Psephology</i> is a combination of <i>psepho-</i> (Greek for “pebble”) and -<i>ology</i> (“the science of”).  This makes sense when you realize that in some ancient Athenian elections votes were cast by putting small stones in a ballot box. Psephology has had a rough couple of years, having failed to predict both “Brexit” and the election of President Trump. </p><p>为了实现他们的梦想，这些笨蛋需要投票，而现在他们根据<i> psephology </ i>的科学来计算他们的竞选活动。这个词在20世纪50年代被创造出来，以“对投票趋势的统计分析”命名，但是psephologists真正喜欢的是预测即将举行的选举的结果。 <i> Psephology </ i>是<i> psepho  -  </ i>（希腊语为“鹅卵石”）和 -  <i> ology </ i>（“科学”）的组合。当你意识到在一些古老的雅典选举中投票是通过在投票箱中放置小石头时，这是有道理的。 Psephology已经有两年的艰难时期，未能预测“脱欧”和特朗普总统的选举。 </ p><p>In English, the right to vote itself is sometimes referred to as <i>suffrage</i>. There is a folk etymology on the internet that holds <i>suffrage</i> to be derived from <i>to suffer</i>, in the older sense of “allow” or “permit,” as when Jesus says “Suffer little children to come unto me,” in the King James Bible. Various groups – non-property-owning white men, African-Americans – were eventually “suffered” to vote, the story goes, and so achieved “suffrage.” Actually, voting has nothing to do with suffering, at least linguistically. (Politically, it may be a different story.) It comes from the Latin word <i>suffragium</i>, which simply means “a vote.”</p><p>在英语中，投票权本身有时被称为<i>选举权</ i>。在互联网上有一个民间词源，其中<i>选举权</ i>来源于<i>遭受</ i>，在旧的“允许”或“允许”意义上，就像耶稣说“让小孩子来到我这里，“在詹姆士国王圣经中。各种群体 - 拥有非财产的白人，非裔美国人 - 最终“遭受”投票，故事发生了，因此实现了“选举权”。实际上，投票与痛苦无关，至少在语言上如此。 （在政治上，它可能是一个不同的故事。）它来自拉丁语<i> suffragium </ i>，它只是意味着“投票”。</ p><p><i>Franchise</i> is another word for this crucial civic duty. It comes to English from the Old French word for “freedom,” and in the 14th century it was a legal term indicating that a person or municipality was free from certain governmental rules. From there it came to mean the granting of “a special privilege or exclusive right,” which, by the 18th century, included the right to vote in elections. </p><p> <i>特许经营权</ i>是这项至关重要的公民义务的另一个词。它来自古法语中的“自由”一词，在14世纪，它是一个法律术语，表明一个人或一个城市没有某些政府规则。从那里开始，它意味着给予“特权或专有权”，到18世纪，它包括在选举中投票的权利。 </ p><p>Now I’ve finally slaked my <i>psephologomania</i>, my “obsessive interest in political words.” That’s not a word, in the world’s opinion, but it should be. </p><p>现在，我终于消除了我对“政治言辞”的强烈兴趣。“在世界范围内，这不是一个词，但它应该是。 </ p>','2018-10-28 16:14:51','N'),(431,'https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Arts/2018/0615/Top-Picks-Parquet-Courts-Wide-Awake-the-Smithsonian-Channel-s-The-Pacific-War-in-Color-and-more','Top Picks: Parquet Courts\' \'Wide Awake,\' the Smithsonian Channel\'s \'The Pacific War in Color,\' and more','<p><b>Unique album</b></p><p> <b>独特专辑</ b> </ p><p>When did you last hear lyrics like these from a rock band? “Swapping parts and roles is not acting but rather emancipation from expectation/ Collectivism and autonomy are not mutually exclusive.” That manifesto, hoarsely hollered during “Total Football” by co-frontman/partymeister Andrew Savage, is from the unique and unhinged <a href=\"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/wide-awake-parquet-courts/32265757?ean=0191402000108\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Parquet Courts release <b>Wide Awake!</b></a> Conceived as a “punk record that you could put on at a party,” it is simultaneously crude, beautiful, profound, and profoundly silly.

This word was coined in the 1950s to give a name to “the statistical analysis of trends in voting,” but what psephologists really seem to enjoy is forecasting the results of upcoming elections. <i>Psephology</i> is a combination of <i>psepho-</i> (Greek for “pebble”) and -<i>ology</i> (“the science of”).  This makes sense when you realize that in some ancient Athenian elections votes were cast by putting small stones in a ballot box. Psephology has had a rough couple of years, having failed to predict both “Brexit” and the election of President Trump. </p><p>为了实现他们的梦想，这些笨蛋需要投票，而现在他们根据<i> psephology </ i>的科学来计算他们的竞选活动。这个词在20世纪50年代被创造出来，以“对投票趋势的统计分析”命名，但是psephologists真正喜欢的是预测即将举行的选举的结果。 <i> Psephology </ i>是<i> psepho  -  </ i>（希腊语为“鹅卵石”）和 -  <i> ology </ i>（“科学”）的组合。当你意识到在一些古老的雅典选举中投票是通过在投票箱中放置小石头时，这是有道理的。 Psephology已经有两年的艰难时期，未能预测“脱欧”和特朗普总统的选举。 </ p><p>In English, the right to vote itself is sometimes referred to as <i>suffrage</i>. There is a folk etymology on the internet that holds <i>suffrage</i> to be derived from <i>to suffer</i>, in the older sense of “allow” or “permit,” as when Jesus says “Suffer little children to come unto me,” in the King James Bible. Various groups – non-property-owning white men, African-Americans – were eventually “suffered” to vote, the story goes, and so achieved “suffrage.” Actually, voting has nothing to do with suffering, at least linguistically. (Politically, it may be a different story.) It comes from the Latin word <i>suffragium</i>, which simply means “a vote.”</p><p>在英语中，投票权本身有时被称为<i>选举权</ i>。在互联网上有一个民间词源，其中<i>选举权</ i>来源于<i>遭受</ i>，在旧的“允许”或“允许”意义上，就像耶稣说“让小孩子来到我这里，“在詹姆士国王圣经中。各种群体 - 拥有非财产的白人，非裔美国人 - 最终“遭受”投票，故事发生了，因此实现了“选举权”。实际上，投票与痛苦无关，至少在语言上如此。 （在政治上，它可能是一个不同的故事。）它来自拉丁语<i> suffragium </ i>，它只是意味着“投票”。</ p><p><i>Franchise</i> is another word for this crucial civic duty. It comes to English from the Old French word for “freedom,” and in the 14th century it was a legal term indicating that a person or municipality was free from certain governmental rules. From there it came to mean the granting of “a special privilege or exclusive right,” which, by the 18th century, included the right to vote in elections. </p><p> <i>特许经营权</ i>是这项至关重要的公民义务的另一个词。它来自古法语中的“自由”一词，在14世纪，它是一个法律术语，表明一个人或一个城市没有某些政府规则。从那里开始，它意味着给予“特权或专有权”，到18世纪，它包括在选举中投票的权利。 </ p><p>Now I’ve finally slaked my <i>psephologomania</i>, my “obsessive interest in political words.” That’s not a word, in the world’s opinion, but it should be. </p><p>现在，我终于消除了我对“政治言辞”的强烈兴趣。“在世界范围内，这不是一个词，但它应该是。 </ p>','2018-10-28 16:17:19','N'),(442,'https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Arts/2018/0615/Top-Picks-Parquet-Courts-Wide-Awake-the-Smithsonian-Channel-s-The-Pacific-War-in-Color-and-more','Top Picks: Parquet Courts\' \'Wide Awake,\' the Smithsonian Channel\'s \'The Pacific War in Color,\' and more','<p><b>Unique album</b></p><p> <b>独特专辑</ b> </ p><p>When did you last hear lyrics like these from a rock band? “Swapping parts and roles is not acting but rather emancipation from expectation/ Collectivism and autonomy are not mutually exclusive.” That manifesto, hoarsely hollered during “Total Football” by co-frontman/partymeister Andrew Savage, is from the unique and unhinged <a href=\"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/wide-awake-parquet-courts/32265757?ean=0191402000108\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Parquet Courts release <b>Wide Awake!</b></a> Conceived as a “punk record that you could put on at a party,” it is simultaneously crude, beautiful, profound, and profoundly silly.

This word was coined in the 1950s to give a name to “the statistical analysis of trends in voting,” but what psephologists really seem to enjoy is forecasting the results of upcoming elections. <i>Psephology</i> is a combination of <i>psepho-</i> (Greek for “pebble”) and -<i>ology</i> (“the science of”).  This makes sense when you realize that in some ancient Athenian elections votes were cast by putting small stones in a ballot box. Psephology has had a rough couple of years, having failed to predict both “Brexit” and the election of President Trump. </p><p>为了实现他们的梦想，这些笨蛋需要投票，而现在他们根据<i> psephology </ i>的科学来计算他们的竞选活动。这个词在20世纪50年代被创造出来，以“对投票趋势的统计分析”命名，但是psephologists真正喜欢的是预测即将举行的选举的结果。 <i> Psephology </ i>是<i> psepho  -  </ i>（希腊语为“鹅卵石”）和 -  <i> ology </ i>（“科学”）的组合。当你意识到在一些古老的雅典选举中投票是通过在投票箱中放置小石头时，这是有道理的。 Psephology已经有两年的艰难时期，未能预测“脱欧”和特朗普总统的选举。 </ p><p>In English, the right to vote itself is sometimes referred to as <i>suffrage</i>. There is a folk etymology on the internet that holds <i>suffrage</i> to be derived from <i>to suffer</i>, in the older sense of “allow” or “permit,” as when Jesus says “Suffer little children to come unto me,” in the King James Bible. Various groups – non-property-owning white men, African-Americans – were eventually “suffered” to vote, the story goes, and so achieved “suffrage.” Actually, voting has nothing to do with suffering, at least linguistically. (Politically, it may be a different story.) It comes from the Latin word <i>suffragium</i>, which simply means “a vote.”</p><p>在英语中，投票权本身有时被称为<i>选举权</ i>。在互联网上有一个民间词源，其中<i>选举权</ i>来源于<i>遭受</ i>，在旧的“允许”或“允许”意义上，就像耶稣说“让小孩子来到我这里，“在詹姆士国王圣经中。各种群体 - 拥有非财产的白人，非裔美国人 - 最终“遭受”投票，故事发生了，因此实现了“选举权”。实际上，投票与痛苦无关，至少在语言上如此。 （在政治上，它可能是一个不同的故事。）它来自拉丁语<i> suffragium </ i>，它只是意味着“投票”。</ p><p><i>Franchise</i> is another word for this crucial civic duty. It comes to English from the Old French word for “freedom,” and in the 14th century it was a legal term indicating that a person or municipality was free from certain governmental rules. From there it came to mean the granting of “a special privilege or exclusive right,” which, by the 18th century, included the right to vote in elections. </p><p> <i>特许经营权</ i>是这项至关重要的公民义务的另一个词。它来自古法语中的“自由”一词，在14世纪，它是一个法律术语，表明一个人或一个城市没有某些政府规则。从那里开始，它意味着给予“特权或专有权”，到18世纪，它包括在选举中投票的权利。 </ p><p>Now I’ve finally slaked my <i>psephologomania</i>, my “obsessive interest in political words.” That’s not a word, in the world’s opinion, but it should be. </p><p>现在，我终于消除了我对“政治言辞”的强烈兴趣。“在世界范围内，这不是一个词，但它应该是。 </ p>','2018-10-28 16:19:08','N'),(452,'https://www.csmonitor.com/Books/Book-Reviews/2018/0611/Voyages-animals-beauty-for-the-youngest-readers','Voyages, animals, beauty for the youngest readers','<p>Seashore, barnyard, outer space – what’s the best setting for the picture books that your favorite young reader will be enjoying this summer?</p><p>海滨，稗，外太空 - 你最喜欢的年轻读者将在今年夏天享受的图画书的最佳设置是什么？</ p><p>The answer is all of the above.</p><p>答案就是以上所有。</ p><p>Award-winning author-illustrator Wallace Edwards wonderfully captures the adventure of a sea voyage in his wordless story <b>Woodrow at Sea</b>.

Around the same time, Chaucer describes a beautiful woman as “debonair, good, glad and sad.” <i>Sad</i>, these lines show, didn’t mean what it does now. </p><p>在1395年的圣经翻译中，上帝告诉先知以西结：“我要束缚那被破坏的，我要使那生病的人感到难过”（以西结书34:16）。大约在同一时间，乔瑟描述了一个美丽的女人是“温文尔雅，善良，高兴和悲伤。”<i>悲伤</ i>，这些线条显示，并不意味着它现在的作用。 </ p><p>In one of its earliest senses, <i>sad</i> signifies “steadfast, firm” and “strong” or “valiant,” according to the Oxford English Dictionary. “I shall make sad” thus means in modern English “I will make strong,” giving us a more familiar translation of this line: “I will strengthen the weak” (New Revised Standard Version).</p><p>根据牛津英语词典，在其最早的一种感官中，<i>悲伤</ i>表示“坚定，坚定”，“强壮”或“勇敢”。 “我会伤心”因此在现代英语中意味着“我会变得坚强”，让我们更熟悉这一句话的翻译：“我将加强弱者”（新修订标准版）。</ p><p><i>Sad</i> was also used to describe a “dignified, grave, serious” appearance. Chaucer’s lady is “glad” – cheerful and affable, but his poem “The Book of the Duchess” also depicts her as a moral exemplar with a stately – <i>sad</i> – mien. <i>Sad</i> sometimes also meant “solid.” “Sad stone walls” were thick and strong in the Middle Ages, not miserable or weepy. </p><p> <i>悲伤</ i>也被用来形容一种“有尊严，严肃，严肃”的外表。乔的女士很“高兴” - 开朗和和蔼可亲，但他的诗“公爵夫人之书”也将她描绘成一个道德范例，有一种庄严的 -  <i>悲伤</ i>  -  mien。 <i>悲伤</ i>有时也意味着“坚固”。“悲伤的石墙”在中世纪是厚重的，而不是悲惨或痛苦。 </ p><p>But theheaviness of <i>sad</i> could be emotional as well as physical. Since the 14th century, the word has also carried the sense of “sorrowful” or “mournful.” </p><p>但<i>悲伤</ i>的重要性既可以是情绪的，也可以是身体的。自14世纪以来，这个词也带有“悲伤”或“悲伤”的感觉。</ p><p>I’ve been thinking about<i> sad </i>because of a reader’s question about the use of the word in “Christ My Refuge,” a poem by Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of The Christian Science Monitor. </p><p>我一直在考虑<i>伤心</ i>，因为读者对“基督我的避难所”这个词的使用有疑问，这是“基督教科学箴言报”创始人玛丽贝克艾迪的一首诗。 </ p><p><i>O’er waiting harpstrings of the mind</i></p><p> <i>等待心灵的竖琴</ i> </ p><p><i>There sweeps a strain,</i></p><p> <i>扫除了一个压力，</ i> </ p><p><i>Low, sad, and sweet, whose measures bind</i></p><p> <i>低，悲伤，甜蜜，其措施与</ i> </ p>结合<p><i>The power of pain.</i></p><p> <i>痛苦的力量。</ i> </ p><p>Here, Mrs. Eddy is describing divine music with the power to control pain. It doesn’t seem <i>sad</i> in the sense of expressing or causing sorrow, since it inspires rapturous thoughts in the next stanza. Instead, her use of <i>sad</i> seems to hark back to its earlier meanings. The music is very likely dignified and serious, as befits a divine melody, and powerful as well – able to “bind” pain and lift the human spirit.</p><p>在这里，艾迪夫人正在描述具有控制痛苦力量的神圣音乐。在表达或引起悲伤的意义上，它似乎并不悲伤，因为它激发了下一节的狂热思想。相反，她对<i> sad </ i>的使用似乎可以追溯到它早期的意义。音乐非常有尊严和严肃，适合神圣的旋律，强大而且能够“束缚”痛苦并提升人类精神。</ p><p><i>Sad</i> here also reflects aspects of a related word that became popular in the Renaissance: <i>melancholy</i>. Melancholy is a poetic kind of sorrow, tinged with aesthetic pleasure, and often referred to as “sweet” or “delightful.” In Jane Austen’s “Northanger Abbey,” for example, a character speaks of “the delightful melancholy” that a grove of fir trees inspired. Eddy’s “low, sad, and sweet” strain might very well be melancholy, too. </p><p> <i>悲伤</ i>这里也反映了文艺复兴时期流行的相关词语的各个方面：<i> melancholy </ i>。忧郁是一种诗意的悲伤，带有审美愉悦，通常被称为“甜蜜”或“令人愉快。”在简奥斯汀的“Northanger修道院”中，一个角色讲的是“令人愉快的忧郁”。杉树的灵感来自。艾迪的“低沉，悲伤，甜蜜”的压力也很可能是忧郁的。 </ p><p>I love poetry, how just one word can spark different interpretations. One thing is clear, though; the poem’s <i>sad</i> has nothing to do with the meaning the word is currently developing on social media. Here, it is an insult, connoting “pitiful” or “pathetic,” largely because of President Trump’s use of the word in his tweets. It’s a sad turn for such an interesting word.</p><p>我喜欢诗歌，只有一个词可以激发不同的解释。但有一点很清楚;这首诗的<i> sad </ i>与这个词目前在社交媒体上的意义无关。在这里，这是一种侮辱，意味着“可怜”或“可怜”，主要是因为特朗普总统在他的推文中使用了这个词。对于这样一个有趣的词来说，这是一个悲伤的转折。</ p>','2018-10-28 16:21:33','N'),(460,'https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/TV/2018/0629/What-are-you-watching-Readers-recommend-their-favorite-sitcoms','What are you watching?

On the back of the album is a note written by album producer George Avakian. Here is what he writes in the first paragraph: “Overshadowing everything else, including the introduction of a new work written expressly for this recording at Newport, Duke Ellington’s performance of ‘Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue’ in the last set of the 1956 Festival turned into one of the most extraordinary moments in the history of this annual event.”</p><p>几天前，我正在查看我上午33点的收集。唱片和其中一个标题为“纽波特的Ellington。”这张专辑是着名的1956年纽波特爵士音乐节的录音。专辑的背面是专辑制作人George Avakian写的一张便条。以下是他在第一段中所写的内容：“在其他一切方面都有所掩盖，包括在纽波特为此录音制作的新作品的介绍，在1956年的最后一集节目中，艾灵顿公爵在\'蓝色的Diminuendo和Crescendo\'演出进入这一年度活动历史上最不寻常的时刻之一。“</ p><p>The highlight was the incredible saxophone solo performance of Paul Gonsalves. He “played for 27 straight choruses,” Mr. Avakian notes. </p><p>亮点是Paul Gonsalves令人难以置信的萨克斯独奏表演。阿瓦基安先生指出，他“连续演奏了27首合唱。” </ p><p>Avakian writes, “Out of sight of the crowd was an unsung hero who is quite possibly the person most responsible for this explosive performance. No one will ever know for sure, but perhaps the Ellington band might never have generated that terrific beat if it weren’t for Jo Jones, who had played drums that night with [jazz pianist] Teddy Wilson. Jo happened to be in a little runway below the left front of the stage, at the base of the steps leading up from the musicians’ tent behind the bandstand. From this vantage point, hidden from the crowd by a high canvas, but visible from the shoulders up to the musicians, Jo egged on the band with nothing more than appreciation and a rolled-up copy of the ‘Christian Science Monitor.’ As Duke (whose voice you can hear from time to time) drove the band in the early stages of ‘Diminuendo and Crescendo,’ first the reed section and then the trombones and finally the rest of the band picked up on Jo, who was shouting encouragement and swatting the edge of the stage with the newspaper, about eighteen inches from my squatting haunch.”</p>Avakian写道，“看不见人群是一个无名英雄，很可能是这个爆炸性表演最负责任的人。没有人会肯定地知道，但也许Ellington乐队可能永远不会产生如此惊人的节拍，如果不是Jo Jones，那晚与[爵士钢琴家] Teddy Wilson一起演奏鼓。 Jo碰巧在舞台左前方的一条小跑道上，在演奏台后面的音乐家帐篷的台阶底部。从这个有利的角度来看，高高的画布隐藏在人群中，但从肩膀到音乐家都可以看到，乔只是欣赏乐队，只是欣赏和卷起“基督教科学箴言报”。 （不时听到你的声音）在“Diminuendo and Crescendo”的早期阶段开车带领乐队，首先是芦苇部分，然后是长号乐队，最后乐队的其他成员选择了乔，他鼓励鼓励和用报纸拍打舞台边缘，距离我的蹲式鞭子大约十八英寸。“</ p><p>I thought this story was worth passing along.</p><p>我认为这个故事值得传递。</ p>','2018-10-28 16:22:34','N'),(463,'https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2018/0727/In-Pakistan-a-yes-we-Khan-moment','In Pakistan, a ‘yes, we Khan’ moment','<p>In three elections so far this year – first Malaysia, then Mexico, and now Pakistan – voters have elected new leaders who not only overturned entrenched parties but whose main campaign pitch was against corruption.

Among the countries in Asia, according to the watchdog group Transparency International, it scores the lowest in the percentage of people who say ordinary citizens can make a difference in the fight against corruption (33 percent).

They may be trapped by a corrupt system, but they also bought into his promise of honesty in governance.

Around the same time, Chaucer describes a beautiful woman as “debonair, good, glad and sad.” <i>Sad</i>, these lines show, didn’t mean what it does now. </p><p>在1395年的圣经翻译中，上帝告诉先知以西结：“我要束缚那被破坏的，我要使那生病的人感到难过”（以西结书34:16）。大约在同一时间，乔瑟描述了一个美丽的女人是“温文尔雅，善良，高兴和悲伤。”<i>悲伤</ i>，这些线条显示，并不意味着它现在的作用。 </ p><p>In one of its earliest senses, <i>sad</i> signifies “steadfast, firm” and “strong” or “valiant,” according to the Oxford English Dictionary. “I shall make sad” thus means in modern English “I will make strong,” giving us a more familiar translation of this line: “I will strengthen the weak” (New Revised Standard Version).</p><p>根据牛津英语词典，在其最早的一种感官中，<i>悲伤</ i>表示“坚定，坚定”，“强壮”或“勇敢”。 “我会伤心”因此在现代英语中意味着“我会变得坚强”，让我们更熟悉这一句话的翻译：“我将加强弱者”（新修订标准版）。</ p><p><i>Sad</i> was also used to describe a “dignified, grave, serious” appearance. Chaucer’s lady is “glad” – cheerful and affable, but his poem “The Book of the Duchess” also depicts her as a moral exemplar with a stately – <i>sad</i> – mien. <i>Sad</i> sometimes also meant “solid.” “Sad stone walls” were thick and strong in the Middle Ages, not miserable or weepy. </p><p> <i>悲伤</ i>也被用来形容一种“有尊严，严肃，严肃”的外表。乔的女士很“高兴” - 开朗和和蔼可亲，但他的诗“公爵夫人之书”也将她描绘成一个道德范例，有一种庄严的 -  <i>悲伤</ i>  -  mien。 <i>悲伤</ i>有时也意味着“坚固”。“悲伤的石墙”在中世纪是厚重的，而不是悲惨或痛苦。 </ p><p>But theheaviness of <i>sad</i> could be emotional as well as physical. Since the 14th century, the word has also carried the sense of “sorrowful” or “mournful.” </p><p>但<i>悲伤</ i>的重要性既可以是情绪的，也可以是身体的。自14世纪以来，这个词也带有“悲伤”或“悲伤”的感觉。</ p><p>I’ve been thinking about<i> sad </i>because of a reader’s question about the use of the word in “Christ My Refuge,” a poem by Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of The Christian Science Monitor. </p><p>我一直在考虑<i>伤心</ i>，因为读者对“基督我的避难所”这个词的使用有疑问，这是“基督教科学箴言报”创始人玛丽贝克艾迪的一首诗。 </ p><p><i>O’er waiting harpstrings of the mind</i></p><p> <i>等待心灵的竖琴</ i> </ p><p><i>There sweeps a strain,</i></p><p> <i>扫除了一个压力，</ i> </ p><p><i>Low, sad, and sweet, whose measures bind</i></p><p> <i>低，悲伤，甜蜜，其措施与</ i> </ p>结合<p><i>The power of pain.</i></p><p> <i>痛苦的力量。</ i> </ p><p>Here, Mrs. Eddy is describing divine music with the power to control pain. It doesn’t seem <i>sad</i> in the sense of expressing or causing sorrow, since it inspires rapturous thoughts in the next stanza. Instead, her use of <i>sad</i> seems to hark back to its earlier meanings. The music is very likely dignified and serious, as befits a divine melody, and powerful as well – able to “bind” pain and lift the human spirit.</p><p>在这里，艾迪夫人正在描述具有控制痛苦力量的神圣音乐。在表达或引起悲伤的意义上，它似乎并不悲伤，因为它激发了下一节的狂热思想。相反，她对<i> sad </ i>的使用似乎可以追溯到它早期的意义。音乐非常有尊严和严肃，适合神圣的旋律，强大而且能够“束缚”痛苦并提升人类精神。</ p><p><i>Sad</i> here also reflects aspects of a related word that became popular in the Renaissance: <i>melancholy</i>. Melancholy is a poetic kind of sorrow, tinged with aesthetic pleasure, and often referred to as “sweet” or “delightful.” In Jane Austen’s “Northanger Abbey,” for example, a character speaks of “the delightful melancholy” that a grove of fir trees inspired. Eddy’s “low, sad, and sweet” strain might very well be melancholy, too. </p><p> <i>悲伤</ i>这里也反映了文艺复兴时期流行的相关词语的各个方面：<i> melancholy </ i>。忧郁是一种诗意的悲伤，带有审美愉悦，通常被称为“甜蜜”或“令人愉快。”在简奥斯汀的“Northanger修道院”中，一个角色讲的是“令人愉快的忧郁”。杉树的灵感来自。艾迪的“低沉，悲伤，甜蜜”的压力也很可能是忧郁的。 </ p><p>I love poetry, how just one word can spark different interpretations. One thing is clear, though; the poem’s <i>sad</i> has nothing to do with the meaning the word is currently developing on social media.

On the back of the album is a note written by album producer George Avakian. Here is what he writes in the first paragraph: “Overshadowing everything else, including the introduction of a new work written expressly for this recording at Newport, Duke Ellington’s performance of ‘Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue’ in the last set of the 1956 Festival turned into one of the most extraordinary moments in the history of this annual event.”</p><p>几天前，我正在查看我上午33点的收集。唱片和其中一个标题为“纽波特的Ellington。”这张专辑是着名的1956年纽波特爵士音乐节的录音。专辑的背面是专辑制作人George Avakian写的一张便条。以下是他在第一段中所写的内容：“在其他一切方面都有所掩盖，包括在纽波特为此录音制作的新作品的介绍，在1956年的最后一集节目中，艾灵顿公爵在\'蓝色的Diminuendo和Crescendo\'演出进入这一年度活动历史上最不寻常的时刻之一。“</ p><p>The highlight was the incredible saxophone solo performance of Paul Gonsalves. He “played for 27 straight choruses,” Mr. Avakian notes. </p><p>亮点是Paul Gonsalves令人难以置信的萨克斯独奏表演。阿瓦基安先生指出，他“连续演奏了27首合唱。” </ p><p>Avakian writes, “Out of sight of the crowd was an unsung hero who is quite possibly the person most responsible for this explosive performance. No one will ever know for sure, but perhaps the Ellington band might never have generated that terrific beat if it weren’t for Jo Jones, who had played drums that night with [jazz pianist] Teddy Wilson. Jo happened to be in a little runway below the left front of the stage, at the base of the steps leading up from the musicians’ tent behind the bandstand. From this vantage point, hidden from the crowd by a high canvas, but visible from the shoulders up to the musicians, Jo egged on the band with nothing more than appreciation and a rolled-up copy of the ‘Christian Science Monitor.’ As Duke (whose voice you can hear from time to time) drove the band in the early stages of ‘Diminuendo and Crescendo,’ first the reed section and then the trombones and finally the rest of the band picked up on Jo, who was shouting encouragement and swatting the edge of the stage with the newspaper, about eighteen inches from my squatting haunch.”</p>Avakian写道，“看不见人群是一个无名英雄，很可能是这个爆炸性表演最负责任的人。没有人会肯定地知道，但也许Ellington乐队可能永远不会产生如此惊人的节拍，如果不是Jo Jones，那晚与[爵士钢琴家] Teddy Wilson一起演奏鼓。 Jo碰巧在舞台左前方的一条小跑道上，在演奏台后面的音乐家帐篷的台阶底部。从这个有利的角度来看，高高的画布隐藏在人群中，但从肩膀到音乐家都可以看到，乔只是欣赏乐队，只是欣赏和卷起“基督教科学箴言报”。 （不时听到你的声音）在“Diminuendo and Crescendo”的早期阶段开车带领乐队，首先是芦苇部分，然后是长号乐队，最后乐队的其他成员选择了乔，他鼓励鼓励和用报纸拍打舞台边缘，距离我的蹲式鞭子大约十八英寸。“</ p><p>I thought this story was worth passing along.</p><p>我认为这个故事值得传递。</ p>','2018-10-28 16:24:45','N'),(474,'https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2018/0727/In-Pakistan-a-yes-we-Khan-moment','In Pakistan, a ‘yes, we Khan’ moment','<p>In three elections so far this year – first Malaysia, then Mexico, and now Pakistan – voters have elected new leaders who not only overturned entrenched parties but whose main campaign pitch was against corruption. If there was a big difference among the three, it was in Pakistan. There the winner of a July 25 election, Imran Khan, an Oxford-educated former cricket star-turned-politician, also promised the opposite of corruption: accountable governance.</p><p>今年迄今为止的三次选举 - 首先是马来西亚，然后是墨西哥，现在是巴基斯坦 - 选民选出了新的领导人，他们不仅推翻了根深蒂固的政党，而且其主要的竞选宣传反对腐败。如果三者之间存在很大差异，那就是在巴基斯坦。 7月25日大选的获胜者伊姆兰·汗（Imran Khan）是一位受过牛津大学教育的前板球明星转型政治家，他也承诺与腐败相对立：负责任的治理。</ p><p>“Our state institutions will be stronger.

The corporation, heavily advertised in the media, is called Worry Free. It promises a hassle-free existence to all those who sign up for a lifetime labor contract in their factory, where one lives and dies in Orwellian regimentation. It’s a crackbrain dystopia – sci-fi slave labor – and Riley doesn’t have the imaginative reach (or the budget) to make much of his conceit.</p>但是，一旦Armie Hammer作为电话营销公司背后的邪恶公司的霸主进入画面，这部电影就会在一段时间内黯然失色。该公司在媒体上广告，被称为“无忧无虑”。它承诺为所有在工厂签订终身劳动合同的人提供无忧无虑的生活，其中一个人在奥威尔军团生活和死亡。这是一个破解性的反乌托邦 - 科幻奴隶劳动力 - 莱利没有足够的想象力（或预算）来实现他的自负。</ p><p>Most of the film, which also has links to Spike Jonze’s \"Being John Malkovich,\" plays like a variation on some of Spike Lee’s more scabrous racial fantasias like “Bamboozled.” It’s also very much in the vein of films like “Get Out,” which also mixed horror, racial comedy, and social consciousness, though here to far less effect.

Around the same time, Chaucer describes a beautiful woman as “debonair, good, glad and sad.” <i>Sad</i>, these lines show, didn’t mean what it does now. </p><p>在1395年的圣经翻译中，上帝告诉先知以西结：“我要束缚那被破坏的，我要使那生病的人感到难过”（以西结书34:16）。大约在同一时间，乔瑟描述了一个美丽的女人是“温文尔雅，善良，高兴和悲伤。”<i>悲伤</ i>，这些线条显示，并不意味着它现在的作用。 </ p><p>In one of its earliest senses, <i>sad</i> signifies “steadfast, firm” and “strong” or “valiant,” according to the Oxford English Dictionary. “I shall make sad” thus means in modern English “I will make strong,” giving us a more familiar translation of this line: “I will strengthen the weak” (New Revised Standard Version).</p><p>根据牛津英语词典，在其最早的一种感官中，<i>悲伤</ i>表示“坚定，坚定”，“强壮”或“勇敢”。 “我会伤心”因此在现代英语中意味着“我会变得坚强”，让我们更熟悉这一句话的翻译：“我将加强弱者”（新修订标准版）。</ p><p><i>Sad</i> was also used to describe a “dignified, grave, serious” appearance. Chaucer’s lady is “glad” – cheerful and affable, but his poem “The Book of the Duchess” also depicts her as a moral exemplar with a stately – <i>sad</i> – mien. <i>Sad</i> sometimes also meant “solid.” “Sad stone walls” were thick and strong in the Middle Ages, not miserable or weepy. </p><p> <i>悲伤</ i>也被用来形容一种“有尊严，严肃，严肃”的外表。乔的女士很“高兴” - 开朗和和蔼可亲，但他的诗“公爵夫人之书”也将她描绘成一个道德范例，有一种庄严的 -  <i>悲伤</ i>  -  mien。 <i>悲伤</ i>有时也意味着“坚固”。“悲伤的石墙”在中世纪是厚重的，而不是悲惨或痛苦。 </ p><p>But theheaviness of <i>sad</i> could be emotional as well as physical. Since the 14th century, the word has also carried the sense of “sorrowful” or “mournful.” </p><p>但<i>悲伤</ i>的重要性既可以是情绪的，也可以是身体的。自14世纪以来，这个词也带有“悲伤”或“悲伤”的感觉。</ p><p>I’ve been thinking about<i> sad </i>because of a reader’s question about the use of the word in “Christ My Refuge,” a poem by Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of The Christian Science Monitor. </p><p>我一直在考虑<i>伤心</ i>，因为读者对“基督我的避难所”这个词的使用有疑问，这是“基督教科学箴言报”创始人玛丽贝克艾迪的一首诗。 </ p><p><i>O’er waiting harpstrings of the mind</i></p><p> <i>等待心灵的竖琴</ i> </ p><p><i>There sweeps a strain,</i></p><p> <i>扫除了一个压力，</ i> </ p><p><i>Low, sad, and sweet, whose measures bind</i></p><p> <i>低，悲伤，甜蜜，其措施与</ i> </ p>结合<p><i>The power of pain.</i></p><p> <i>痛苦的力量。</ i> </ p><p>Here, Mrs. Eddy is describing divine music with the power to control pain. It doesn’t seem <i>sad</i> in the sense of expressing or causing sorrow, since it inspires rapturous thoughts in the next stanza. Instead, her use of <i>sad</i> seems to hark back to its earlier meanings. The music is very likely dignified and serious, as befits a divine melody, and powerful as well – able to “bind” pain and lift the human spirit.</p><p>在这里，艾迪夫人正在描述具有控制痛苦力量的神圣音乐。在表达或引起悲伤的意义上，它似乎并不悲伤，因为它激发了下一节的狂热思想。相反，她对<i> sad </ i>的使用似乎可以追溯到它早期的意义。音乐非常有尊严和严肃，适合神圣的旋律，强大而且能够“束缚”痛苦并提升人类精神。</ p><p><i>Sad</i> here also reflects aspects of a related word that became popular in the Renaissance: <i>melancholy</i>. Melancholy is a poetic kind of sorrow, tinged with aesthetic pleasure, and often referred to as “sweet” or “delightful.” In Jane Austen’s “Northanger Abbey,” for example, a character speaks of “the delightful melancholy” that a grove of fir trees inspired. Eddy’s “low, sad, and sweet” strain might very well be melancholy, too. </p><p> <i>悲伤</ i>这里也反映了文艺复兴时期流行的相关词语的各个方面：<i> melancholy </ i>。忧郁是一种诗意的悲伤，带有审美愉悦，通常被称为“甜蜜”或“令人愉快。”在简奥斯汀的“Northanger修道院”中，一个角色讲的是“令人愉快的忧郁”。杉树的灵感来自。艾迪的“低沉，悲伤，甜蜜”的压力也很可能是忧郁的。 </ p><p>I love poetry, how just one word can spark different interpretations. One thing is clear, though; the poem’s <i>sad</i> has nothing to do with the meaning the word is currently developing on social media. Here, it is an insult, connoting “pitiful” or “pathetic,” largely because of President Trump’s use of the word in his tweets. It’s a sad turn for such an interesting word.</p><p>我喜欢诗歌，只有一个词可以激发不同的解释。但有一点很清楚;这首诗的<i> sad </ i>与这个词目前在社交媒体上的意义无关。在这里，这是一种侮辱，意味着“可怜”或“可怜”，主要是因为特朗普总统在他的推文中使用了这个词。对于这样一个有趣的词来说，这是一个悲伤的转折。</ p>','2018-10-28 16:25:33','N'),(481,'https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-Pacific/2018/0727/New-Zealand-approves-paid-leave-for-domestic-violence-survivors','New Zealand approves paid leave for domestic violence survivors','<p>New Zealand has become one of the only countries offering paid leave to domestic violence survivors, after approving a law aimed at protecting victims.</p><p>在批准旨在保护受害者的法律后，新西兰已成为向家庭暴力幸存者提供带薪休假的唯一国家之一。</ p><p>New Zealand has one of the worst records for domestic violence among developed nations.

Given that the construction is finished, why don’t we call it a builded or a built? The answer has to do with the great variety of functions that “-ing” performs in modern English.</p><p>一位读者最近询问为什么建筑物被称为建筑物。鉴于施工已经完成，我们为什么不称它为建筑物或建筑物？答案与“-ing”在现代英语中执行的各种功能有关。</ p><p>First of all, “-ing” forms the present participle of verbs. This participle is used in the present continuous tense to describe ongoing action. “He is building the wall” means he is still in the process; the wall is not finished. Present participles can also be adjectives: “the running water,” “the perspiring tourist.” These adjectives, too, imply that the action is ongoing and incomplete – the tourist is sweating in perpetuity.</p><p>首先，“-ing”形成动词的现在分词。该分词用于当前的连续时态来描述正在进行的动作。 “他正在建造隔离墙”意味着他仍在进行中;墙没完工。现在的分词也可以是形容词：“自来水”，“出汗的游客。”这些形容词也暗示行动是持续的和不完整的 - 游客永远满头大汗。</ p><p>Adding “-ing” also produces the gerund, which, you might remember, is a noun formed from a verb. “Singing is fun” – “singing” is a gerund, the subject of the sentence. “Building card towers quickly is my passion” – “building” is a gerund. As we can see from the previous sentence, gerunds still evince some characteristics of verbs, taking direct objects (“card towers”) and being modified by adverbs (“quickly”), not adjectives, as most nouns are. Like the present participle, the gerund also implies that an action is continuing, without an endpoint.</p><p>添加“-ing”也会产生动名词，你可能记得，动名词是由动词组成的名词。 “唱歌很有趣” - “唱歌”是一个动名词，句子的主题。 “快速建造卡塔是我的热情” - “建筑”是一个动名词。正如我们从上一句中可以看到的那样，动名词仍然表现出动词的一些特征，采用直接对象（“卡塔”）并被副词（“快速”）修饰，而不是形容词，就像大多数名词一样。与现在的分词一样，动名词也意味着行动仍在继续，没有终点。</ p><p>Building, in the sense of “She designed a beautiful building,” is neither a participle nor a gerund, but the sense of ongoing, incomplete action influences our attitudes to the word. </p><p>建筑，在“她设计了一座美丽的建筑”的意义上，既不是分词也不是动名词，但持续不完整的行动感会影响我们对这个词的态度。 </ p><p>Building in our sense is a verbal noun (sometimes, confusingly, also called a deverbal noun), a “real noun,” if you will. In contrast to gerunds, these are modified by adjectives (“the beautiful building”) and can take the plural (“the buildings”), just like any other noun. </p><p>在我们的意义上建立一个口头名词（有时，令人困惑，也称为deverbal名词），一个“真正的名词”，如果你愿意的话。与动名词形成鲜明对比的是，这些动词由形容词（“美丽的建筑物”）修饰，并且可以采用复数形式（“建筑物”），就像任何其他名词一样。 </ p><p>They are most commonly formed from verbs by the addition of a suffix such as “-ment” (“an achievement”), “-ance” (“a disappearance”), and, in our case, “-ing” (“a wedding,” “a painting,” and “a building”).</p><p>它们最常见的是通过添加后缀来形成动词，例如“-ment”（“成就”），“-ance”（“失踪”），在我们的例子中，“-ing” （“婚礼”，“画作”和“建筑物”）。</ p><p>This way of using “-ing” to make verbal nouns is very old; “-ing” was already producing words in the 8th century. It only took over from “-ende” and “-inde” as the standard form of the present participle in the 14th century, and gained the flexibility to combine with nearly all verbs to make gerunds around the same time. The first “-ing” words, then, were not burdened with the participial and gerundial baggage of ongoing or continuous action.</p><p>这种使用“-ing”来制作动词名词的方式非常古老; “-ing”已经在8世纪产生了文字。它仅仅取代了“-ende”和“-inde”作为14世纪现在分词的标准形式，并且获得了与几乎所有动词相结合的灵活性，可以同时制作动名词。那么，第一个“ - ”字就不会受到正在进行或持续行动的分歧和动漫的负担。</ p><p>In fact, early on, “-ing” was actually used to make words that carry a sense of completion, that, as the Oxford English Dictionary explains, “express a completed action.” </p><p>事实上，在早期，“-ing”实际上用于制作具有完整感的单词，正如牛津英语词典解释的那样，“表达完成的动作。”</ p><p>A building, then, doesn’t need to be a built. The “-ing” suffix itself implies that it is finished. We just don’t realize it today, after centuries of influence from those pervasive competing “-ing” forms, the present participle and gerund.</p><p>然后，建筑物不需要是建筑物。 “-ing”后缀本身意味着它已经完成。我们今天没有意识到这一点，经过几个世纪的影响，来自那些普遍存在的竞争性“形式”形式，现在的分词和动名词。</ p>','2018-10-28 16:32:50','N'),(497,'https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Arts/2018/0803/Top-Picks-The-Fiat-Lex-podcast-Culture-Pass-and-more','Top Picks: The Fiat Lex podcast, Culture Pass, and more','<p><b>Music source</b></p><p> <b>音乐来源</ b> </ p><p>Though late to the music streaming party, <a href=\"https://music.youtube.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><b>YouTube Music</b></a> – launched in its current incarnation less than three months ago – has its charms.

As far back as the 11th century, “holidays,” especially the major feast days, were times of “festivity, recreation, and amusement,” as the Oxford English Dictionary puts it. </p><p>假期</ i>的词源很容易看出，来自“神圣的日子”，这是一个具有特殊宗教意义的日子，经常庆祝圣徒的生活，在此期间没有工作要做。早在11世纪，“节日”，特别是主要的节日，就像牛津英语词典所说的那样，是“节日，娱乐和娱乐”的时代。 </ p><p>The number of holidays steadily increased during the Middle Ages, until a medieval Englishman would have had the luxury of 40 to 50 days a year off work, depending on where he lived, in addition to a free day on Sundays. </p><p>在中世纪，假期数量稳步增加，直到一个中世纪的英国人每年下班40至50天，取决于他住的地方，以及周日的免费日。 </ p><p>During the Reformation, Henry VIII abolished most of the holidays that fell during the law terms and in summer, partly because of the Protestant suspicion of saints, but more practically, because, according to historian Eamon Duffy, “the excessive number of holidays were impoverishing the people by hindering agriculture.” “The people” took a different view and organized an uprising – the Pilgrimage of Grace – partly to protect their days off.</p><p>在宗教改革期间，亨利八世废除了在法律条款和夏季期间倒下的大部分假期，部分原因是新教徒怀疑圣徒，但更实际的是，因为根据历史学家埃蒙·达菲的说法，“过多的假期通过阻碍农业，假期使人民变得贫穷。“”人们“采取了不同的观点，组织起义 - 格雷斯朝圣 - 部分是为了保护他们的日子。</ p><p>Though at first the religious and festive senses of <i>holiday</i> were inseparable, the word gradually came to be used for any kind of relaxing break from work. As the word became secularized, the number of authorized holidays was reduced, until by 1834 most workers had only four official days off a year, in addition to Sundays. Many factory workers extended this time by staying home on “Saint Monday” to recover from what they had gotten up to the day before. </p><p>虽然起初<i>假日</ i>的宗教和节日感觉是不可分割的，但这个词逐渐被用来放松休息。随着世俗化这个词，授权假期的数量减少了，直到1834年，大多数工人除了星期日外，一年只有四个正式休假日。许多工厂工人通过在“圣周一”停留在家中来延长他们从前一天的状态恢复过来。 </ p><p>By the late 19th century, employers were compromising and offering half-day Saturdays, the beginning of the “weekend,” a term first used in 1879. In 1908, an innovative mill in New England gave its employees all of Saturday off, and the practice spread widely during the Great Depression as a way to keep employment up. It took 400 years, but finally workers could enjoy as many holidays as they had in the 15th century. </p><p>到了19世纪末，雇主们正在妥协并提供半天的星期六，这是“周末”的开始，这个词在1879年首次使用。1908年，新英格兰的一家创新工厂在星期六给予员工关闭这种做法在大萧条时期广泛传播，作为保持就业的一种方式。花了400年时间，但最终工人们可以享受15世纪的假期。 </ p><p>Mine is going to be a little bit of a <i>busman’s</i> (British) or <i>postman’s </i>(US) <i>holiday. </i>These terms refer to a break during which a person continues to do for enjoyment what he or she normally does for employment.

Given that the construction is finished, why don’t we call it a builded or a built? The answer has to do with the great variety of functions that “-ing” performs in modern English.</p><p>一位读者最近询问为什么建筑物被称为建筑物。鉴于施工已经完成，我们为什么不称它为建筑物或建筑物？答案与“-ing”在现代英语中执行的各种功能有关。</ p><p>First of all, “-ing” forms the present participle of verbs. This participle is used in the present continuous tense to describe ongoing action. “He is building the wall” means he is still in the process; the wall is not finished. Present participles can also be adjectives: “the running water,” “the perspiring tourist.” These adjectives, too, imply that the action is ongoing and incomplete – the tourist is sweating in perpetuity.</p><p>首先，“-ing”形成动词的现在分词。该分词用于当前的连续时态来描述正在进行的动作。 “他正在建造隔离墙”意味着他仍在进行中;墙没完工。现在的分词也可以是形容词：“自来水”，“出汗的游客。”这些形容词也暗示行动是持续的和不完整的 - 游客永远满头大汗。</ p><p>Adding “-ing” also produces the gerund, which, you might remember, is a noun formed from a verb. “Singing is fun” – “singing” is a gerund, the subject of the sentence. “Building card towers quickly is my passion” – “building” is a gerund. As we can see from the previous sentence, gerunds still evince some characteristics of verbs, taking direct objects (“card towers”) and being modified by adverbs (“quickly”), not adjectives, as most nouns are. Like the present participle, the gerund also implies that an action is continuing, without an endpoint.</p><p>添加“-ing”也会产生动名词，你可能记得，动名词是由动词组成的名词。 “唱歌很有趣” - “唱歌”是一个动名词，句子的主题。 “快速建造卡塔是我的热情” - “建筑”是一个动名词。正如我们从上一句中可以看到的那样，动名词仍然表现出动词的一些特征，采用直接对象（“卡塔”）并被副词（“快速”）修饰，而不是形容词，就像大多数名词一样。与现在的分词一样，动名词也意味着行动仍在继续，没有终点。</ p><p>Building, in the sense of “She designed a beautiful building,” is neither a participle nor a gerund, but the sense of ongoing, incomplete action influences our attitudes to the word. </p><p>建筑，在“她设计了一座美丽的建筑”的意义上，既不是分词也不是动名词，但持续不完整的行动感会影响我们对这个词的态度。 </ p><p>Building in our sense is a verbal noun (sometimes, confusingly, also called a deverbal noun), a “real noun,” if you will. In contrast to gerunds, these are modified by adjectives (“the beautiful building”) and can take the plural (“the buildings”), just like any other noun. </p><p>在我们的意义上建立一个口头名词（有时，令人困惑，也称为deverbal名词），一个“真正的名词”，如果你愿意的话。与动名词形成鲜明对比的是，这些动词由形容词（“美丽的建筑物”）修饰，并且可以采用复数形式（“建筑物”），就像任何其他名词一样。 </ p><p>They are most commonly formed from verbs by the addition of a suffix such as “-ment” (“an achievement”), “-ance” (“a disappearance”), and, in our case, “-ing” (“a wedding,” “a painting,” and “a building”).</p><p>它们最常见的是通过添加后缀来形成动词，例如“-ment”（“成就”），“-ance”（“失踪”），在我们的例子中，“-ing” （“婚礼”，“画作”和“建筑物”）。</ p><p>This way of using “-ing” to make verbal nouns is very old; “-ing” was already producing words in the 8th century. It only took over from “-ende” and “-inde” as the standard form of the present participle in the 14th century, and gained the flexibility to combine with nearly all verbs to make gerunds around the same time. The first “-ing” words, then, were not burdened with the participial and gerundial baggage of ongoing or continuous action.</p><p>这种使用“-ing”来制作动词名词的方式非常古老; “-ing”已经在8世纪产生了文字。它仅仅取代了“-ende”和“-inde”作为14世纪现在分词的标准形式，并且获得了与几乎所有动词相结合的灵活性，可以同时制作动名词。那么，第一个“ - ”字就不会受到正在进行或持续行动的分歧和动漫的负担。</ p><p>In fact, early on, “-ing” was actually used to make words that carry a sense of completion, that, as the Oxford English Dictionary explains, “express a completed action.” </p><p>事实上，在早期，“-ing”实际上用于制作具有完整感的单词，正如牛津英语词典解释的那样，“表达完成的动作。”</ p><p>A building, then, doesn’t need to be a built. The “-ing” suffix itself implies that it is finished. We just don’t realize it today, after centuries of influence from those pervasive competing “-ing” forms, the present participle and gerund.</p><p>然后，建筑物不需要是建筑物。 “-ing”后缀本身意味着它已经完成。我们今天没有意识到这一点，经过几个世纪的影响，来自那些普遍存在的竞争性“形式”形式，现在的分词和动名词。</ p>','2018-10-28 16:34:31','N'),(504,'https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2018/0907/The-truth-about-South-African-land-seizures','The truth about South African ‘land seizures’','<p>A respect for property rights is seen as a fundamental aspect of American society.

Suddenly I felt as if I were 12 years old, happy and relaxed, sitting in her kitchen. I can remember what her house looked like, though it was sold 20 years ago – her three-level plant stand, the plates lining the walls, the window over her sink – but these visual memories don’t have the power that smell does. The funny thing is, I can’t even begin to describe the odor that was so distinctively hers. The best I can do is this: “It smelled like my grandmother’s house.”</p><p>我最近有一天回家了，由于我不太明白的原因，我的客厅闻起来像我祖母的房子。突然间，我感觉好像我12岁，快乐和放松，坐在她的厨房里。我记得她的房子看起来像什么，虽然它是20年前出售的 - 她的三层植物架，墙上的盘子，窗户上的水槽 - 但这些视觉记忆没有气味的力量。有趣的是，我甚至无法开始描述她如此独特的气味。我能做的最好的就是：“它闻起来像我祖母的房子。”</ p><p>It’s a common experience, and a common linguistic problem. In cultures worldwide, people have powerful <i>olfactory memories</i>. This odor-memory link is also called “the Proust phenomenon,” after Marcel Proust’s famous description of the feelings evoked by a madeleine dipped in tea in “Remembrance of Things Past.”</p><p>这是一种常见的经历，也是一种常见的语言问题。在世界各地的文化中，人们拥有强大的<i>嗅觉记忆</ i>。这种气味记忆的联系也被称为“普鲁斯特现象”，这是马塞尔·普鲁斯特（Marcel Proust）对“纪念过去的事物”中蘸着茶的马德琳所引发的感情的着名描述。</ p><p>Olfactory memories seem to be more closely bound up with emotions than are visual or auditory ones. Not all these memories are pleasant, of course, and smells can also trigger feelings of pain.</p><p>嗅觉记忆似乎与视觉或听觉记忆的关系更紧密。当然，并非所有这些记忆都是愉快的，并且气味也会引发痛苦感。</ p><p>It is surprisingly hard for English-speakers to describe the odors that occasion such strong emotions, however. English possesses almost no abstract smell words that pick out links or themes among unrelated aromas. </p><p>然而，说英语的人很难描述出这种强烈情绪的气味。英语几乎没有抽象气味的单词，在不相关的香气中挑选出链接或主题。 </ p><p>We have plenty of these in the visual realm. “Yellow,” for example, identifies a characteristic that bananas, lemons, some cars, some flowers, old book pages, and the sun all share.  </p><p>我们在视觉领域有很多这些。例如，“黄色”标识了香蕉，柠檬，一些汽车，一些鲜花，旧书页和太阳共享的特征。 </ p><p>But for odors, we don’t have many more than the vague “musty” (smells old and stale) and “musky” (smells perfumey). We usually have no choice but to say that one thing smells like another – like a banana, like garlic, like diesel fuel. </p><p>但对于气味，我们没有比模糊的“发霉”（闻起来陈旧和陈旧）和“麝香”（闻起来香味）更多。我们通常别无选择，只能说有一种东西闻起来像另一种东西 - 像香蕉，像大蒜，就像柴油一样。 </ p><p>A few languages, though, do have a rich odor vocabulary. Linguist Asifa Majid has found that the Jahai, the Semaq Beri, and the Maniq, hunter-gatherer groups in Malaysia and Thailand, employ a wide range of abstract smell words and can identify aromas as easily as we can colors. The Jahai have a word, for example, that describes “the seemingly dissimilar smell of petrol, smoke, bat poop, root of wild ginger and wood of wild mango.”</p>但是，有些语言确实有很多气味词汇。语言学家Asifa Majid发现，Jahai，Semaq Beri和Maniq，马来西亚和泰国的狩猎采集团，使用各种抽象气味词，可以尽可能轻松地识别香气。例如，Jahai有一句话描述了“看似不一样的汽油，烟雾，蝙蝠粪，野生姜根和野生芒果木的味道。”</ p><p>Last year my cat got sprayed by a skunk, and the vet told me to wash its face with coffee to cover the stink.

Given that the construction is finished, why don’t we call it a builded or a built? The answer has to do with the great variety of functions that “-ing” performs in modern English.</p><p>一位读者最近询问为什么建筑物被称为建筑物。鉴于施工已经完成，我们为什么不称它为建筑物或建筑物？答案与“-ing”在现代英语中执行的各种功能有关。</ p><p>First of all, “-ing” forms the present participle of verbs. This participle is used in the present continuous tense to describe ongoing action. “He is building the wall” means he is still in the process; the wall is not finished. Present participles can also be adjectives: “the running water,” “the perspiring tourist.” These adjectives, too, imply that the action is ongoing and incomplete – the tourist is sweating in perpetuity.</p><p>首先，“-ing”形成动词的现在分词。该分词用于当前的连续时态来描述正在进行的动作。 “他正在建造隔离墙”意味着他仍在进行中;墙没完工。现在的分词也可以是形容词：“自来水”，“出汗的游客。”这些形容词也暗示行动是持续的和不完整的 - 游客永远满头大汗。</ p><p>Adding “-ing” also produces the gerund, which, you might remember, is a noun formed from a verb. “Singing is fun” – “singing” is a gerund, the subject of the sentence. “Building card towers quickly is my passion” – “building” is a gerund. As we can see from the previous sentence, gerunds still evince some characteristics of verbs, taking direct objects (“card towers”) and being modified by adverbs (“quickly”), not adjectives, as most nouns are. Like the present participle, the gerund also implies that an action is continuing, without an endpoint.</p><p>添加“-ing”也会产生动名词，你可能记得，动名词是由动词组成的名词。 “唱歌很有趣” - “唱歌”是一个动名词，句子的主题。 “快速建造卡塔是我的热情” - “建筑”是一个动名词。正如我们从上一句中可以看到的那样，动名词仍然表现出动词的一些特征，采用直接对象（“卡塔”）并被副词（“快速”）修饰，而不是形容词，就像大多数名词一样。与现在的分词一样，动名词也意味着行动仍在继续，没有终点。</ p><p>Building, in the sense of “She designed a beautiful building,” is neither a participle nor a gerund, but the sense of ongoing, incomplete action influences our attitudes to the word. </p><p>建筑，在“她设计了一座美丽的建筑”的意义上，既不是分词也不是动名词，但持续不完整的行动感会影响我们对这个词的态度。 </ p><p>Building in our sense is a verbal noun (sometimes, confusingly, also called a deverbal noun), a “real noun,” if you will. In contrast to gerunds, these are modified by adjectives (“the beautiful building”) and can take the plural (“the buildings”), just like any other noun. </p><p>在我们的意义上建立一个口头名词（有时，令人困惑，也称为deverbal名词），一个“真正的名词”，如果你愿意的话。与动名词形成鲜明对比的是，这些动词由形容词（“美丽的建筑物”）修饰，并且可以采用复数形式（“建筑物”），就像任何其他名词一样。 </ p><p>They are most commonly formed from verbs by the addition of a suffix such as “-ment” (“an achievement”), “-ance” (“a disappearance”), and, in our case, “-ing” (“a wedding,” “a painting,” and “a building”).</p><p>它们最常见的是通过添加后缀来形成动词，例如“-ment”（“成就”），“-ance”（“失踪”），在我们的例子中，“-ing” （“婚礼”，“画作”和“建筑物”）。</ p><p>This way of using “-ing” to make verbal nouns is very old; “-ing” was already producing words in the 8th century. It only took over from “-ende” and “-inde” as the standard form of the present participle in the 14th century, and gained the flexibility to combine with nearly all verbs to make gerunds around the same time. The first “-ing” words, then, were not burdened with the participial and gerundial baggage of ongoing or continuous action.</p><p>这种使用“-ing”来制作动词名词的方式非常古老; “-ing”已经在8世纪产生了文字。它仅仅取代了“-ende”和“-inde”作为14世纪现在分词的标准形式，并且获得了与几乎所有动词相结合的灵活性，可以同时制作动名词。那么，第一个“ - ”字就不会受到正在进行或持续行动的分歧和动漫的负担。</ p><p>In fact, early on, “-ing” was actually used to make words that carry a sense of completion, that, as the Oxford English Dictionary explains, “express a completed action.” </p><p>事实上，在早期，“-ing”实际上用于制作具有完整感的单词，正如牛津英语词典解释的那样，“表达完成的动作。”</ p><p>A building, then, doesn’t need to be a built. The “-ing” suffix itself implies that it is finished. We just don’t realize it today, after centuries of influence from those pervasive competing “-ing” forms, the present participle and gerund.</p><p>然后，建筑物不需要是建筑物。 “-ing”后缀本身意味着它已经完成。我们今天没有意识到这一点，经过几个世纪的影响，来自那些普遍存在的竞争性“形式”形式，现在的分词和动名词。</ p>','2018-10-28 16:36:28','N'),(510,'https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Education/2018/0830/DeVos-to-roll-out-new-rules-for-college-sexual-misconduct-cases','DeVos to roll out new rules for college sexual misconduct cases','<p>US Education Secretary Betsy DeVos will issue new rules to colleges and universities for addressing sexual harassment or assault cases, lessening their liability for incidents that happen off-campus, The New York Times reported on Wednesday.</p>美国教育部长Betsy DeVos将向学院和大学发布新的规则，以解决性骚扰或攻击案件，减轻他们对校外发生的事件的责任，“纽约时报”周三报道。</ p><p>The new policies would also strengthen the rights of students accused of assault, harassment, or rape and seek to provide more support for victims, the Times reported.</p>据“泰晤士报”报道，新政策还将加强被控殴打，骚扰或强奸的学生的权利，并寻求为受害者提供更多支持。</ p><p>Department of Education spokeswoman Liz Hill declined to discuss the proposed recommendations with Reuters.</p><p>教育部发言人利兹希尔拒绝与路透社商讨建议。</ p><p>\"We are in the midst of a deliberative process.

English-speakers, along with most people who do not live as hunter-gatherers, are generally quite bad at identifying odors. When tested, most people can name only about 50 percent of even familiar aromas such as coffee, cinnamon, and garlic. But we do know when something stinks. For bad smells, we have a fairly rich, if nonspecific, vocabulary.</p><p>上周，我们谈到了英语中几乎没有“抽象气味词”，这些词在不同气味中找出了潜在的相似之处。讲英语的人，以及大多数不是狩猎采集者的人，通常都很难识别气味。经过测试，大多数人只能说出约50％甚至熟悉的香气，如咖啡，肉桂和大蒜。但我们确实知道什么时候会发臭。对于难闻的气味，我们有一个相当丰富的，如果没有特定的词汇。</ p><p>Many words indicate that something offends our noses without characterizing the smell. <i>Stench</i> indicates that you find it disagreeable, but it could be dirty socks, rotting vegetables, or leaking gas. <i>Fetid</i> likewise describes “an offensive smell” without adding much detail about <i>how</i> it smells; in the same way, <i>mephitic</i> – usually used for gases or air – means “foul-smelling” or “offensive to the smell,” according to the Oxford English Dictionary. In the Renaissance through the 18th century, <i>noisome</i> (from the Old French word for “annoy”) could apply to anything from smoke to mud to cellar air to excrement.</p><p>许多词语表明，在没有表征气味的情况下，有些东西会冒犯我们的鼻子。 <i> Stench </ i>表示您发现它不愉快，但它可能是脏袜子，腐烂的蔬菜或泄漏的气体。 <i> Fetid </ i>同样描述了“令人不快的气味”而没有添加关于它如何</ i>气味的更多细节;同样地，<i> mephitic </ i>  - 通常用于气体或空气 - 意味着“恶臭”或“冒犯气味”，根据牛津英语词典。在18世纪的文艺复兴时期，<i> noisome </ i>（来自古法语中的“恼人”一词）可适用于从烟雾到泥泞，从地窖到粪便的任何事物。</ p><p>Meat going bad can be <i>putrid </i>or <i>rank,</i> implying advanced decomposition. A <i>rancid</i> smell is “stale and sour,” like old butter, oil, or fish, spoiled but just beginning to decay. <i>Nidor</i> and its adjective, <i>nidorous</i>, indicate the smell of burning meat or fat, as produced by tallow candles or “eructation,” as the great 18th-century lexicographer Samuel Johnson explains in his dictionary – a <i>nidorosity</i> is an especially sulfuric burp. Today few of us regularly encounter strong smells of these kinds. In the not-so-distant past, however, without garbage collection, refrigeration, or sewage systems, there was much more occasion for such words.</p><p>肉变坏可能是<i>腐败</ i>或<i>排名，</ i>意味着高级分解。一种<腐臭</ i>气味是“陈旧和酸味”，就像旧的黄油，油或鱼一样，变质但刚刚开始腐烂。 <i> Nidor </ i>及其形容词<i> nidorous </ i>表示由18世纪伟大的词典编纂者Samuel Johnson解释的由牛脂蜡烛或“eructation”产生的燃烧肉或脂肪的气味在他的字典中 -  <n> nidorosity </ i>是一种特别含硫的打嗝。今天，我们很少有人经常遇到这种强烈的气味。然而，在不久的将来，如果没有垃圾收集，制冷或污水处理系统，这种话语就会有更多的机会。</ p><p>English words that describe <i>good</i> smells are few and far between. An <i>aroma</i> is generally pleasant or at least inoffensive, and a <i>fragrant</i> perfume or spice gives off sweet smells. <i>Redolent</i> was originally one of these rare beasts; flowers, meadows, and wine all had “redolent” – meaning “sweet-smelling, fragrant” – odors during the 15th to 18th centuries. Its sense has since shifted, and it is sometimes now used as yet another nonspecific descriptor of unpleasant smells, as in a “redolent stench.” </p><p>描述<i> good </ i>气味的英文单词很少见。香气</ i>通常是令人愉快的或至少是无害的，并且香料或香料散发出甜味。 <i> Redolent </ i>原本是这些罕见的野兽之一;鲜花，草地和葡萄酒都有“红润” - 意思是“香气扑鼻，香气扑鼻” -  15至18世纪的气味。它的意义已经发生了变化，现在它有时被用作另一种令人不快的气味的非特定描述，就像“一股恶臭”。</ p><p>But in today’s usage the word retains a positive connotation. When we say something is “redolent of” or “redolent with” something else, we mean that it is suggestive or reminiscent of it. The word can be used literally (“the stew was redolent of peppers and garlic”) or more figuratively (“the air was redolent of spring,” or “the buildings were redolent of antiquity”). Redolent highlights the strong connection between sense and recollection.</p><p>但在今天的用法中，这个词保留了一个积极的含义。当我们说某些东西是“松散的”或“带有”其他东西时，我们的意思是它暗示或让人联想到它。这个词可以用字面意思（“炖汤是辣椒和大蒜”）或更具象征性地（“空气中充满了春天”，或“建筑物是古老的”）。 Redolent强调了感觉和回忆之间的紧密联系。</ p>','2018-10-28 16:38:37','N'),(517,'https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/TV/2018/0831/What-are-you-watching-Readers-recommend-Ethel-Ernest-The-Wonder-Years','What are you watching?

Notably, in a country where 70 to 80 percent of private enterprises are still family run, Mr. Ma did not name a family member. Rather, one of the world’s biggest e-commerce companies will be led by Daniel Zhang, an 11-year Alibaba veteran chosen only for his “professional talent.”</p><p>周一，中国最富有的个人，科技巨头阿里巴巴的马云，宣布他在19年前创立的公司的继任者。值得注意的是，在一个70％至80％的私营企业仍然是家庭经营的国家，马先生没有说出家庭成员的姓名。相反，世界上最大的电子商务公司之一将由Daniel Zhang领导，他是一位11年的阿里巴巴老将，仅仅因为他的“专业人才”而被选中。</ p><p>The history of many countries can be marked by a transition away from a reliance on hereditary succession in both business and politics, or the belief that traits of leadership flow through bloodlines and family pedigree. Ma is a true innovator in many ways, most famously for building an innovative online shopping market worth more than the economies of most countries. But his legacy may lie in showing how China as well as much of Asia can produce founders of successful organizations not inclined to pass the reins of power to relatives.</p><p>许多国家的历史可以通过过度依赖于在商业和政治中依赖遗传继承，或者相信领导的特征流经血统和家庭血统。 Ma在很多方面都是真正的创新者，最着名的是建立一个比大多数国家的经济更有价值的创新网上购物市场。但他的遗产可能在于展示中国以及亚洲大部分地区如何能够成功组织的创始人，而不是倾向于将权力交给亲戚。</ p><p>“Alibaba was never about Jack Ma,” he stated in announcing his succession plan.</p>“阿里巴巴从不关注马云，”他在宣布继任计划时说道。</ p><p>Instead, the former schoolteacher who came from humble origins is stepping back from day-to-day operations because he has built a corporate culture based on innovation, transparency, and accountability. “For the last 10 years, we kept working on these ingredients,” he stated.</p>相反，这位来自卑微起源的前教师正在退出日常运营，因为他建立了一种基于创新，透明度和问责制的企业文化。 “在过去的十年里，我们一直在研究这些成分，”他说。</ p><p>The company’s future will depend on developing “droves of talent,” he said. And in a society with a long tradition of suspicion toward those outside the family circle, Ma has built an “architecture of trust” with customers, who number over half a billion.

Many of them, like Ma, have rejected nepotistic privilege in favor of systems based on merit and integrity. They swim in a talent pool, not a gene pool.

English-speakers, along with most people who do not live as hunter-gatherers, are generally quite bad at identifying odors. When tested, most people can name only about 50 percent of even familiar aromas such as coffee, cinnamon, and garlic. But we do know when something stinks. For bad smells, we have a fairly rich, if nonspecific, vocabulary.</p><p>上周，我们谈到了英语中几乎没有“抽象气味词”，这些词在不同气味中找出了潜在的相似之处。讲英语的人，以及大多数不是狩猎采集者的人，通常都很难识别气味。经过测试，大多数人只能说出约50％甚至熟悉的香气，如咖啡，肉桂和大蒜。但我们确实知道什么时候会发臭。对于难闻的气味，我们有一个相当丰富的，如果没有特定的词汇。</ p><p>Many words indicate that something offends our noses without characterizing the smell. <i>Stench</i> indicates that you find it disagreeable, but it could be dirty socks, rotting vegetables, or leaking gas. <i>Fetid</i> likewise describes “an offensive smell” without adding much detail about <i>how</i> it smells; in the same way, <i>mephitic</i> – usually used for gases or air – means “foul-smelling” or “offensive to the smell,” according to the Oxford English Dictionary. In the Renaissance through the 18th century, <i>noisome</i> (from the Old French word for “annoy”) could apply to anything from smoke to mud to cellar air to excrement.</p><p>许多词语表明，在没有表征气味的情况下，有些东西会冒犯我们的鼻子。 <i> Stench </ i>表示您发现它不愉快，但它可能是脏袜子，腐烂的蔬菜或泄漏的气体。 <i> Fetid </ i>同样描述了“令人不快的气味”而没有添加关于它如何</ i>气味的更多细节;同样地，<i> mephitic </ i>  - 通常用于气体或空气 - 意味着“恶臭”或“冒犯气味”，根据牛津英语词典。在18世纪的文艺复兴时期，<i> noisome </ i>（来自古法语中的“恼人”一词）可适用于从烟雾到泥泞，从地窖到粪便的任何事物。</ p><p>Meat going bad can be <i>putrid </i>or <i>rank,</i> implying advanced decomposition. A <i>rancid</i> smell is “stale and sour,” like old butter, oil, or fish, spoiled but just beginning to decay. <i>Nidor</i> and its adjective, <i>nidorous</i>, indicate the smell of burning meat or fat, as produced by tallow candles or “eructation,” as the great 18th-century lexicographer Samuel Johnson explains in his dictionary – a <i>nidorosity</i> is an especially sulfuric burp. Today few of us regularly encounter strong smells of these kinds. In the not-so-distant past, however, without garbage collection, refrigeration, or sewage systems, there was much more occasion for such words.</p><p>肉变坏可能是<i>腐败</ i>或<i>排名，</ i>意味着高级分解。一种<腐臭</ i>气味是“陈旧和酸味”，就像旧的黄油，油或鱼一样，变质但刚刚开始腐烂。 <i> Nidor </ i>及其形容词<i> nidorous </ i>表示由18世纪伟大的词典编纂者Samuel Johnson解释的由牛脂蜡烛或“eructation”产生的燃烧肉或脂肪的气味在他的字典中 -  <n> nidorosity </ i>是一种特别含硫的打嗝。今天，我们很少有人经常遇到这种强烈的气味。然而，在不久的将来，如果没有垃圾收集，制冷或污水处理系统，这种话语就会有更多的机会。</ p><p>English words that describe <i>good</i> smells are few and far between. An <i>aroma</i> is generally pleasant or at least inoffensive, and a <i>fragrant</i> perfume or spice gives off sweet smells. <i>Redolent</i> was originally one of these rare beasts; flowers, meadows, and wine all had “redolent” – meaning “sweet-smelling, fragrant” – odors during the 15th to 18th centuries. Its sense has since shifted, and it is sometimes now used as yet another nonspecific descriptor of unpleasant smells, as in a “redolent stench.” </p><p>描述<i> good </ i>气味的英文单词很少见。香气</ i>通常是令人愉快的或至少是无害的，并且香料或香料散发出甜味。 <i> Redolent </ i>原本是这些罕见的野兽之一;鲜花，草地和葡萄酒都有“红润” - 意思是“香气扑鼻，香气扑鼻” -  15至18世纪的气味。它的意义已经发生了变化，现在它有时被用作另一种令人不快的气味的非特定描述，就像“一股恶臭”。</ p><p>But in today’s usage the word retains a positive connotation. When we say something is “redolent of” or “redolent with” something else, we mean that it is suggestive or reminiscent of it. The word can be used literally (“the stew was redolent of peppers and garlic”) or more figuratively (“the air was redolent of spring,” or “the buildings were redolent of antiquity”). Redolent highlights the strong connection between sense and recollection.</p><p>但在今天的用法中，这个词保留了一个积极的含义。当我们说某些东西是“松散的”或“带有”其他东西时，我们的意思是它暗示或让人联想到它。这个词可以用字面意思（“炖汤是辣椒和大蒜”）或更具象征性地（“空气中充满了春天”，或“建筑物是古老的”）。 Redolent强调了感觉和回忆之间的紧密联系。</ p>','2018-10-28 16:40:40','N'),(527,'https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/TV/2018/0831/What-are-you-watching-Readers-recommend-Ethel-Ernest-The-Wonder-Years','What are you watching?

Suddenly I felt as if I were 12 years old, happy and relaxed, sitting in her kitchen. I can remember what her house looked like, though it was sold 20 years ago – her three-level plant stand, the plates lining the walls, the window over her sink – but these visual memories don’t have the power that smell does.

Linguist Asifa Majid has found that the Jahai, the Semaq Beri, and the Maniq, hunter-gatherer groups in Malaysia and Thailand, employ a wide range of abstract smell words and can identify aromas as easily as we can colors. The Jahai have a word, for example, that describes “the seemingly dissimilar smell of petrol, smoke, bat poop, root of wild ginger and wood of wild mango.”</p>但是，有些语言确实有很多气味词汇。语言学家Asifa Majid发现，Jahai，Semaq Beri和Maniq，马来西亚和泰国的狩猎采集团，使用各种抽象气味词，可以尽可能轻松地识别香气。例如，Jahai有一句话描述了“看似不一样的汽油，烟雾，蝙蝠粪，野生姜根和野生芒果木的味道。”</ p><p>Last year my cat got sprayed by a skunk, and the vet told me to wash its face with coffee to cover the stink.

In the Renaissance through the 18th century, <i>noisome</i> (from the Old French word for “annoy”) could apply to anything from smoke to mud to cellar air to excrement.</p><p>许多词语表明，在没有表征气味的情况下，有些东西会冒犯我们的鼻子。 <i> Stench </ i>表示您发现它不愉快，但它可能是脏袜子，腐烂的蔬菜或泄漏的气体。 <i> Fetid </ i>同样描述了“令人不快的气味”而没有添加关于它如何</ i>气味的更多细节;同样地，<i> mephitic </ i>  - 通常用于气体或空气 - 意味着“恶臭”或“冒犯气味”，根据牛津英语词典。在18世纪的文艺复兴时期，<i> noisome </ i>（来自古法语中的“恼人”一词）可适用于从烟雾到泥泞，从地窖到粪便的任何事物。</ p><p>Meat going bad can be <i>putrid </i>or <i>rank,</i> implying advanced decomposition. A <i>rancid</i> smell is “stale and sour,” like old butter, oil, or fish, spoiled but just beginning to decay. <i>Nidor</i> and its adjective, <i>nidorous</i>, indicate the smell of burning meat or fat, as produced by tallow candles or “eructation,” as the great 18th-century lexicographer Samuel Johnson explains in his dictionary – a <i>nidorosity</i> is an especially sulfuric burp. Today few of us regularly encounter strong smells of these kinds. In the not-so-distant past, however, without garbage collection, refrigeration, or sewage systems, there was much more occasion for such words.</p><p>肉变坏可能是<i>腐败</ i>或<i>排名，</ i>意味着高级分解。一种<腐臭</ i>气味是“陈旧和酸味”，就像旧的黄油，油或鱼一样，变质但刚刚开始腐烂。 <i> Nidor </ i>及其形容词<i> nidorous </ i>表示由18世纪伟大的词典编纂者Samuel Johnson解释的由牛脂蜡烛或“eructation”产生的燃烧肉或脂肪的气味在他的字典中 -  <n> nidorosity </ i>是一种特别含硫的打嗝。今天，我们很少有人经常遇到这种强烈的气味。然而，在不久的将来，如果没有垃圾收集，制冷或污水处理系统，这种话语就会有更多的机会。</ p><p>English words that describe <i>good</i> smells are few and far between. An <i>aroma</i> is generally pleasant or at least inoffensive, and a <i>fragrant</i> perfume or spice gives off sweet smells. <i>Redolent</i> was originally one of these rare beasts; flowers, meadows, and wine all had “redolent” – meaning “sweet-smelling, fragrant” – odors during the 15th to 18th centuries. Its sense has since shifted, and it is sometimes now used as yet another nonspecific descriptor of unpleasant smells, as in a “redolent stench.” </p><p>描述<i> good </ i>气味的英文单词很少见。香气</ i>通常是令人愉快的或至少是无害的，并且香料或香料散发出甜味。 <i> Redolent </ i>原本是这些罕见的野兽之一;鲜花，草地和葡萄酒都有“红润” - 意思是“香气扑鼻，香气扑鼻” -  15至18世纪的气味。它的意义已经发生了变化，现在它有时被用作另一种令人不快的气味的非特定描述，就像“一股恶臭”。</ p><p>But in today’s usage the word retains a positive connotation. When we say something is “redolent of” or “redolent with” something else, we mean that it is suggestive or reminiscent of it. The word can be used literally (“the stew was redolent of peppers and garlic”) or more figuratively (“the air was redolent of spring,” or “the buildings were redolent of antiquity”). Redolent highlights the strong connection between sense and recollection.</p><p>但在今天的用法中，这个词保留了一个积极的含义。当我们说某些东西是“松散的”或“带有”其他东西时，我们的意思是它暗示或让人联想到它。这个词可以用字面意思（“炖汤是辣椒和大蒜”）或更具象征性地（“空气中充满了春天”，或“建筑物是古老的”）。 Redolent强调了感觉和回忆之间的紧密联系。</ p>','2018-10-28 16:43:03','N'),(539,'https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Readers-Respond/2018/0929/Readers-write-Examining-Genghis-Khan-fishing-solution-the-power-of-love-politics-insight-solutions-in-France-reading-back-to-front','Readers write: Examining Genghis Khan, fishing solution, the power of love, politics insight, solutions in France, reading back to front','<p><b>Examining Genghis Khan</b></p><p> <b>检查成吉思汗</ b> </ p><p>The Aug. 17 Monitor Daily article “<a href=\"/Daily/2018/20180817/Russia-takes-a-new-look-at-an-old-enemy-Genghis-Khan\" target=\"_blank\">Russia takes a new look at an old enemy: Genghis Khan</a>” was a very interesting history of an area rarely studied in classes.</p><p> 8月17日“每日监视”文章“<a href =”/ Daily / 2018/20180817 / Russia-take-a-new-an-old-an-enemy-Genghis-Khan“target =”_ blank“ >俄罗斯重新审视了一个古老的敌人：成吉思汗</a>“是一个非常有趣的历史，在一个很少在课堂上学习的地区。</ p><p>Robert Guzauskas</p><p> Robert Guzauskas </ p><p><i>West Palm Beach, Fla.</i></p><p> <i>佛罗里达州西棕榈滩</ i> </ p><p><b>Fishing solution</b></p><p> <b>钓鱼解决方案</ b> </ p><p>The Aug. 20 Monitor Daily article “<a href=\"/Daily/2018/20180820/Dogfish-for-dinner-Going-down-market-to-save-a-fishery\" target=\"_blank\">Dogfish for dinner?

For nearly six months, Ethiopia has shown promise of being such a model. A new prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, has so far achieved a whirlwind of reforms, such as releasing political prisoners and making peace with neighboring Eritrea. But now he has begun to search for ways that Ethiopia, with its more than 80 ethnic groups in Africa’s second-most-populous nation, can work together to form a civic identity that prevents violence. </p><p>由于种族群体的多样性，非洲长期以来需要具有包容性的治理模式，特别是在种族差异驱动的冲突之后。近六个月来，埃塞俄比亚已经显示出成为这样一种模式的希望。迄今为止，新任总理阿比艾哈迈德实现了一系列改革，例如释放政治犯和与邻国厄立特里亚实现和平。但现在他已经开始寻找方法，埃塞俄比亚及其在非洲人口第二多的国家的80多个民族可以共同努力，形成一种防止暴力的公民身份。 </ p><p>With the new freedoms allowed under Mr. Abiy, ethnic fighting has picked up in recent months. Many groups are settling old scores, often over land rights. Hundreds have been killed. More than 2 million have been displaced. The old authoritarian political structure in place since 1991 was able to suppress many of these ethnic-based resentments.

(My son’s first word was “underdog,” which is a different story). “Duh” is typical of the early sounds babies make all over the world. When they are around six to eight months old, babies begin to babble, experimenting with consonant-vowel combinations like “da da,” “bi bi,” or “koy koy.” This babbling has produced the only two words found in a majority of the world’s languages: <i>mama </i>and <i>papa</i>. </p><p>我女儿的第一个字是“呃”，我丈夫和我解释为“鸭子”，因为她喜欢她的小黄色橡皮鸭。 （我儿子的第一个词是“失败者”，这是一个不同的故事）。 “Duh”是婴儿在世界各地发出的早期声音的典型代表。当他们大约六到八个月大时，婴儿开始唠叨，尝试使用辅音 - 元音组合，如“da da”，“bi bi”或“koy koy”。这种bab呀学语产生了大多数人发现的两个单词世界语言：<i>妈妈</ i>和<i>爸爸</ i>。 </ p><p>It is not surprising that <i>mama</i> is an intimate word for <i>mother </i>in both German and Urdu, since these are distantly related Indo-European languages. But variations of <i>mama</i> are found across the globe in completely unrelated languages, from Mandarin (<i>ma</i><i>–</i><i>ma</i>) in China to Igbo (<i>mama</i>) in Nigeria to Tamil (<i>amma</i>) in India. <i>Papa </i>varies a bit more: It’s <i>tatay</i> in Tagalog, <i>baba</i> in Persian, and <i>daa</i> in Chechen, for example. Linguist Roman Jakobson hypothesized that ma, closely followed by pa/da/ta/ba, are the easiest sounds for new human tongues to produce. Over and over, excited parents heard this “talking” and hopefully assumed that these sounds referred to them. Eventually the babbling was codified into words, and so wherever there are parents, there are children who refer to them with some form of <i>mama</i> and <i>papa</i>. </p><p> <i> mama </ i>对于德语和乌尔都语中的<i>母亲</ i>来说是一个亲密的词，这并不奇怪，因为它们与印欧语言有很大关系。但是<i>妈妈</ i>的变体在全球范围内以完全不相关的语言发现，来自普通话（<i> ma </ i> <i>  -  </ i> <i> ma </ i>）中国到尼日利亚的Igbo（<i> mama </ i>）到印度的泰米尔语（<i> amma </ i>）。 <p> Papa </ i>变化多一点：在菲律宾语中它是<i> tatay </ i>，在波斯语中是<i> baba </ i>，在车臣中是<i> daa </ i> 。语言学家罗曼·雅各布森（Roman Jakobson）假设马，紧跟pa / da / ta / ba，是新的人类语言产生的最简单的声音。一遍又一遍，兴奋的父母听到这种“说话”，并希望这些声音能够传达给他们。最终，这些bab呀学语被编成了文字，所以只要有父母，就会有孩子用某种形式的<i> mama </ i>和<i> papa </ i>来称呼他们。 </ p><p>Another of these baby sounds has been surprisingly productive of English words: “ba ba.” This combination gives us <i>babble</i> itself, the name for babies’ early linguistic experiments as well as for any foolish, incoherent, or especially voluble speech. <i>Babble </i>is thus an example of onomatopoeia, since its “sound suggests its sense,” as Merriam-Webster’s dictionary puts it. <i>Baby</i> too comes from the “ba ba” of infant vocalization. </p><p>这些婴儿声音中的另一个令人惊讶地产生了英语单词：“ba ba。”这种组合给了我们<bab> babble </ i>本身，婴儿早期语言实验的名称以及任何愚蠢的，语无伦次，或特别是言语不合时宜。因此，<i> Babble </ i>是拟声词的一个例子，因为它的“声音暗示了它的意义”，正如梅里亚姆 - 韦伯斯特的字典所说的那样。婴儿</ i>也来自婴儿发声的“ba ba”。 </ p><p>Baby babbling has also given rise to two quite negative words. The ancient Greeks famously considered anyone who did not speak Greek to be “uncivilized.” They mocked these people as <i>barbaroi</i> because they were thought to make incomprehensible noises – “ba ba” or “bar bar” – like babies rather than speaking a “real” language. </p>婴儿bab呀学语也引起了两个相当消极的词。古希腊人着名地认为任何不会说希腊语的人都是“不文明的”。他们嘲笑这些人是<i> barbaroi </ i>，因为他们被认为会发出难以理解的声音 - “ba ba”或“bar bar” - 就像婴儿而不是说“真正的”语言。 </ p><p>In English, <i>barbarian</i> now means more or less the same thing, referring to a savage, uncultured person. In the 13th century, the “ba ba” sound also produced the French word <i>babewene</i>, a foolish or stupid person. This became the English <i>baboon</i>, the common term for ground-dwelling monkeys with large canine teeth, of the genus <i>Papio</i>.</p><p>在英语中，<i>野蛮人</ i>现在或多或少都是一样的，指的是一个野蛮的，没有文化的人。在13世纪，“巴巴”的声音也产生了法语单词<i> babewene </ i>，一个愚蠢或愚蠢的人。这成为了英语<i> baboon </ i>，这是具有大型犬齿的地栖猴的常用术语，属于<i> Papio </ i>。</ p><p>One word that seems as if it must have a similar origin is <i>babel</i>, but this word for “a confusing hubbub or din” doesn’t actually derive from baby noises. Babel and its tower, though, is our topic for next week.</p><p>似乎它必须具有相似来源的一个词是<i> babel </ i>，但是这个词对于“令人困惑的喧哗或喧闹”实际上并非源自婴儿的噪音。然而，巴贝尔及其塔楼是我们下周的主题。</ p>','2018-10-28 16:47:09','N'),(553,'https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/TV/2018/0928/What-are-you-watching-Readers-recommend-Veronica-Mars-A-Place-to-Call-Home','What are you watching?

But when they built “a tower with its top in the heavens” (Genesis 11:4, New Revised Standard Version) in an attempt to rival God himself, He punished them by confounding their language and scattering them across the earth. Their city, the story concludes, “was called Babel, because there the Lord confused the language of all the earth” (11:9). “Babel” resembles the Hebrew word for confusion, <i>balal</i>.</p><p>最初，根据圣经中的故事，所有人都说一种通用语言。但是当他们建造“天上有塔顶”（创世纪11：4，新修订的标准版）以试图与上帝对抗时，他通过混淆他们的语言并将它们分散在地球上来惩罚他们。故事的结论是，他们的城市“被称为巴别，因为在那里，主混淆了整个地球的语言”（11：9）。 “Babel”类似于希伯来语中的混淆词，<i> balal </ i>。</ p><p>Over the centuries, a surprising number of theologians and linguists have tried to “reverse Babel” and create universally intelligible languages. In the 13th century Catalan monk Ramon Llull devised a mathematical system that used charts, diagrams, letters, and the principles of logic to derive “Christian truths” from various premises that were acceptable to believers in any of the Abrahamic religions. Because of its mathematical nature, his Ars Combinatoria could be understood by anyone, he hoped, even illiterate people. </p><p>几个世纪以来，数量惊人的神学家和语言学家试图“扭转巴贝尔”并创造出普遍可理解的语言。在13世纪，加泰罗尼亚僧侣Ramon Llull设计了一个数学系统，该系统使用图表，图表，字母和逻辑原理，从任何亚伯拉罕宗教信徒都可以接受的各种前提中获得“基督教真理”。由于其数学性质，他希望，即使是文盲的人也可以理解他的Ars Combinatoria。 </ p><p>Seventeenth-century clergyman and scientist John Wilkins reasoned that in humanity’s first language, the relationship between signifier and signified would not have been arbitrary. “Fish” and “poisson” both pick out the same animal, but these words are agreed upon by convention, with no inherent connection to the thing they represent. In Adamic language, in contrast, words were not arbitrary but revealed the essence of what they named. Wilkins thus invented a “philosophical language” that attempted to do just that – words in his language do not stand for concepts, they actually <i>define</i> them. </p><p>十七世纪的牧师和科学家约翰威尔金斯认为，在人类的第一语言中，能指和被指明之间的关系不会是任意的。 “鱼”和“泊松”都选择相同的动物，但这些词是按照惯例达成一致的，与它们所代表的东西没有固有的联系。相比之下，在亚当语中，词语并不是随意的，而是揭示了它们所命名的本质。威尔金斯因此发明了一种试图做到这一点的“哲学语言” - 他的语言中的单词不代表概念，它们实际上是<i>定义</ i>它们。 </ p><p>His word for dog, <i>Zit</i>α, for example, encodes its place in a complicated system of classification. According to his scheme, dog belongs to the categories beast (Zi); oblong-headed dog-kind (i); and European, terrestrial, bigger kind, noted for docility (α), which equals <i>Zit</i>α.  </p>例如，他对狗的说法，<i> Zit </ i>α，在一个复杂的分类系统中编码。根据他的计划，狗属于类别野兽（Zi）;长方形的狗类（i）;和欧洲的，陆地的，更大的一种，以温顺（α）着称，等于<i> Zit </ i>α。 </ p><p>Perhaps the most famous universal language was created in 1887 by Ludwik Zamenhof: Esperanto. Zamenhof had a “dream of the unity of humankind,” believing that a single language could bring lasting peace to the world. </p><p>也许最着名的通用语言是由Ludwik Zamenhof于1887年创立的：世界语。 Zamenhof有一个“人类团结的梦想”，相信一种语言可以为世界带来持久的和平。 </ p><p>To facilitate its spread, he designed Esperanto to be easy to learn – he thought the basics could be mastered in a week – with a predictable grammar and a lexicon derived from common European languages. Of all the universal languages, this one has been the most successful, boasting around 100,000 speakers and a place in Google Translate. </p><p>为了促进其传播，他设计世界语易于学习 - 他认为基础知识可以在一周内掌握 - 具有可预测的语法和源自普通欧洲语言的词汇。在所有通用语言中，这个通用语言最为成功，拥有大约100,000个发言者和谷歌翻译。 </ p><p>None of these languages has ever truly caught on; we are still post-Babel.

It is a sci-fi film based on a book by Russian author Stanislaw Lem and stars George Clooney. The film is set almost entirely on a space station orbiting the planet Solaris, adding flashbacks to the previous experiences of its main characters while they were on Earth. Clooney’s character struggles with the questions of why mysterious things are happening to the people near Solaris, his beliefs and memories, and reconciling what was lost with an opportunity for a second chance. The film mainly consists of questions, both spoken and implied, that are answered with more questions, none of which are really answered, leaving one to draw his or her own conclusions. The endings are many and are what the individual viewer wants them to be.</p><p> <b> Solaris </ b>是我最喜欢观看和重新播放的电影之一。这是一部基于俄罗斯作家斯坦尼斯瓦夫·莱姆和明星乔治·克鲁尼的书的科幻电影。这部电影几乎全部放在绕着行星轨道运行的太空站上，为他们在地球上的主要人物之前的经历添加了倒叙。克鲁尼的性格与为什么神秘事物发生在Solaris附近的人，他的信仰和记忆，并将失去的东西与第二次机会的机会调和的问题进行斗争。这部电影主要由口头和暗示的问题组成，这些问题可以回答更多的问题，其中没有一个问题得到真正的回答，留下一个人来得出他或她自己的结论。结局很多，是个人观众想要的结果。</ p><p><b>– Karen Neff, Mystic, Conn.</b></p><p> <b>  -  Karen Neff，Mystic，Conn。</ b> </ p><p>My favorite sitcom is <b>Designing Women</b>.

(My son’s first word was “underdog,” which is a different story). “Duh” is typical of the early sounds babies make all over the world. When they are around six to eight months old, babies begin to babble, experimenting with consonant-vowel combinations like “da da,” “bi bi,” or “koy koy.” This babbling has produced the only two words found in a majority of the world’s languages: <i>mama </i>and <i>papa</i>. </p><p>我女儿的第一个字是“呃”，我丈夫和我解释为“鸭子”，因为她喜欢她的小黄色橡皮鸭。 （我儿子的第一个词是“失败者”，这是一个不同的故事）。 “Duh”是婴儿在世界各地发出的早期声音的典型代表。当他们大约六到八个月大时，婴儿开始唠叨，尝试使用辅音 - 元音组合，如“da da”，“bi bi”或“koy koy”。这种bab呀学语产生了大多数人发现的两个单词世界语言：<i>妈妈</ i>和<i>爸爸</ i>。 </ p><p>It is not surprising that <i>mama</i> is an intimate word for <i>mother </i>in both German and Urdu, since these are distantly related Indo-European languages. But variations of <i>mama</i> are found across the globe in completely unrelated languages, from Mandarin (<i>ma</i><i>–</i><i>ma</i>) in China to Igbo (<i>mama</i>) in Nigeria to Tamil (<i>amma</i>) in India. <i>Papa </i>varies a bit more: It’s <i>tatay</i> in Tagalog, <i>baba</i> in Persian, and <i>daa</i> in Chechen, for example. Linguist Roman Jakobson hypothesized that ma, closely followed by pa/da/ta/ba, are the easiest sounds for new human tongues to produce. Over and over, excited parents heard this “talking” and hopefully assumed that these sounds referred to them. Eventually the babbling was codified into words, and so wherever there are parents, there are children who refer to them with some form of <i>mama</i> and <i>papa</i>. </p><p> <i> mama </ i>对于德语和乌尔都语中的<i>母亲</ i>来说是一个亲密的词，这并不奇怪，因为它们与印欧语言有很大关系。但是<i>妈妈</ i>的变体在全球范围内以完全不相关的语言发现，来自普通话（<i> ma </ i> <i>  -  </ i> <i> ma </ i>）中国到尼日利亚的Igbo（<i> mama </ i>）到印度的泰米尔语（<i> amma </ i>）。 <p> Papa </ i>变化多一点：在菲律宾语中它是<i> tatay </ i>，在波斯语中是<i> baba </ i>，在车臣中是<i> daa </ i> 。语言学家罗曼·雅各布森（Roman Jakobson）假设马，紧跟pa / da / ta / ba，是新的人类语言产生的最简单的声音。一遍又一遍，兴奋的父母听到这种“说话”，并希望这些声音能够传达给他们。最终，这些bab呀学语被编成了文字，所以只要有父母，就会有孩子用某种形式的<i> mama </ i>和<i> papa </ i>来称呼他们。 </ p><p>Another of these baby sounds has been surprisingly productive of English words: “ba ba.” This combination gives us <i>babble</i> itself, the name for babies’ early linguistic experiments as well as for any foolish, incoherent, or especially voluble speech. <i>Babble </i>is thus an example of onomatopoeia, since its “sound suggests its sense,” as Merriam-Webster’s dictionary puts it. <i>Baby</i> too comes from the “ba ba” of infant vocalization. </p><p>这些婴儿声音中的另一个令人惊讶地产生了英语单词：“ba ba。”这种组合给了我们<bab> babble </ i>本身，婴儿早期语言实验的名称以及任何愚蠢的，语无伦次，或特别是言语不合时宜。因此，<i> Babble </ i>是拟声词的一个例子，因为它的“声音暗示了它的意义”，正如梅里亚姆 - 韦伯斯特的字典所说的那样。婴儿</ i>也来自婴儿发声的“ba ba”。 </ p><p>Baby babbling has also given rise to two quite negative words. The ancient Greeks famously considered anyone who did not speak Greek to be “uncivilized.” They mocked these people as <i>barbaroi</i> because they were thought to make incomprehensible noises – “ba ba” or “bar bar” – like babies rather than speaking a “real” language. </p>婴儿bab呀学语也引起了两个相当消极的词。古希腊人着名地认为任何不会说希腊语的人都是“不文明的”。他们嘲笑这些人是<i> barbaroi </ i>，因为他们被认为会发出难以理解的声音 - “ba ba”或“bar bar” - 就像婴儿而不是说“真正的”语言。 </ p><p>In English, <i>barbarian</i> now means more or less the same thing, referring to a savage, uncultured person. In the 13th century, the “ba ba” sound also produced the French word <i>babewene</i>, a foolish or stupid person. This became the English <i>baboon</i>, the common term for ground-dwelling monkeys with large canine teeth, of the genus <i>Papio</i>.</p><p>在英语中，<i>野蛮人</ i>现在或多或少都是一样的，指的是一个野蛮的，没有文化的人。在13世纪，“巴巴”的声音也产生了法语单词<i> babewene </ i>，一个愚蠢或愚蠢的人。这成为了英语<i> baboon </ i>，这是具有大型犬齿的地栖猴的常用术语，属于<i> Papio </ i>。</ p><p>One word that seems as if it must have a similar origin is <i>babel</i>, but this word for “a confusing hubbub or din” doesn’t actually derive from baby noises. Babel and its tower, though, is our topic for next week.</p><p>似乎它必须具有相似来源的一个词是<i> babel </ i>，但是这个词对于“令人困惑的喧哗或喧闹”实际上并非源自婴儿的噪音。然而，巴贝尔及其塔楼是我们下周的主题。</ p>','2018-10-28 16:50:01','N'),(568,'https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/TV/2018/0928/What-are-you-watching-Readers-recommend-Veronica-Mars-A-Place-to-Call-Home','What are you watching?

After anti-corruption protests broke out in 2013, the country’s prosecutors and judges were emboldened to go after the political elite, many of whom took bribes with impunity or laundered money taken from the state-run oil firm, Petrobras.

But when they built “a tower with its top in the heavens” (Genesis 11:4, New Revised Standard Version) in an attempt to rival God himself, He punished them by confounding their language and scattering them across the earth. Their city, the story concludes, “was called Babel, because there the Lord confused the language of all the earth” (11:9). “Babel” resembles the Hebrew word for confusion, <i>balal</i>.</p><p>最初，根据圣经中的故事，所有人都说一种通用语言。但是当他们建造“天上有塔顶”（创世纪11：4，新修订的标准版）以试图与上帝对抗时，他通过混淆他们的语言并将它们分散在地球上来惩罚他们。故事的结论是，他们的城市“被称为巴别，因为在那里，主混淆了整个地球的语言”（11：9）。 “Babel”类似于希伯来语中的混淆词，<i> balal </ i>。</ p><p>Over the centuries, a surprising number of theologians and linguists have tried to “reverse Babel” and create universally intelligible languages. In the 13th century Catalan monk Ramon Llull devised a mathematical system that used charts, diagrams, letters, and the principles of logic to derive “Christian truths” from various premises that were acceptable to believers in any of the Abrahamic religions. Because of its mathematical nature, his Ars Combinatoria could be understood by anyone, he hoped, even illiterate people. </p><p>几个世纪以来，数量惊人的神学家和语言学家试图“扭转巴贝尔”并创造出普遍可理解的语言。在13世纪，加泰罗尼亚僧侣Ramon Llull设计了一个数学系统，该系统使用图表，图表，字母和逻辑原理，从任何亚伯拉罕宗教信徒都可以接受的各种前提中获得“基督教真理”。由于其数学性质，他希望，即使是文盲的人也可以理解他的Ars Combinatoria。 </ p><p>Seventeenth-century clergyman and scientist John Wilkins reasoned that in humanity’s first language, the relationship between signifier and signified would not have been arbitrary. “Fish” and “poisson” both pick out the same animal, but these words are agreed upon by convention, with no inherent connection to the thing they represent. In Adamic language, in contrast, words were not arbitrary but revealed the essence of what they named. Wilkins thus invented a “philosophical language” that attempted to do just that – words in his language do not stand for concepts, they actually <i>define</i> them. </p><p>十七世纪的牧师和科学家约翰威尔金斯认为，在人类的第一语言中，能指和被指明之间的关系不会是任意的。 “鱼”和“泊松”都选择相同的动物，但这些词是按照惯例达成一致的，与它们所代表的东西没有固有的联系。相比之下，在亚当语中，词语并不是随意的，而是揭示了它们所命名的本质。威尔金斯因此发明了一种试图做到这一点的“哲学语言” - 他的语言中的单词不代表概念，它们实际上是<i>定义</ i>它们。 </ p><p>His word for dog, <i>Zit</i>α, for example, encodes its place in a complicated system of classification.

Readers recommend \'Solaris,\' \'Chesapeake Shores\'','<p><b>Solaris</b> is one of my favorite movies to watch and rewatch. It is a sci-fi film based on a book by Russian author Stanislaw Lem and stars George Clooney. The film is set almost entirely on a space station orbiting the planet Solaris, adding flashbacks to the previous experiences of its main characters while they were on Earth. Clooney’s character struggles with the questions of why mysterious things are happening to the people near Solaris, his beliefs and memories, and reconciling what was lost with an opportunity for a second chance. The film mainly consists of questions, both spoken and implied, that are answered with more questions, none of which are really answered, leaving one to draw his or her own conclusions. The endings are many and are what the individual viewer wants them to be.</p><p> <b> Solaris </ b>是我最喜欢观看和重新播放的电影之一。这是一部基于俄罗斯作家斯坦尼斯瓦夫·莱姆和明星乔治·克鲁尼的书的科幻电影。这部电影几乎全部放在绕着行星轨道运行的太空站上，为他们在地球上的主要人物之前的经历添加了倒叙。克鲁尼的性格与为什么神秘事物发生在Solaris附近的人，他的信仰和记忆，并将失去的东西与第二次机会的机会调和的问题进行斗争。这部电影主要由口头和暗示的问题组成，这些问题可以回答更多的问题，其中没有一个问题得到真正的回答，留下一个人来得出他或她自己的结论。结局很多，是个人观众想要的结果。</ p><p><b>– Karen Neff, Mystic, Conn.</b></p><p> <b>  -  Karen Neff，Mystic，Conn。</ b> </ p><p>My favorite sitcom is <b>Designing Women</b>.

(My son’s first word was “underdog,” which is a different story). “Duh” is typical of the early sounds babies make all over the world. When they are around six to eight months old, babies begin to babble, experimenting with consonant-vowel combinations like “da da,” “bi bi,” or “koy koy.” This babbling has produced the only two words found in a majority of the world’s languages: <i>mama </i>and <i>papa</i>. </p><p>我女儿的第一个字是“呃”，我丈夫和我解释为“鸭子”，因为她喜欢她的小黄色橡皮鸭。 （我儿子的第一个词是“失败者”，这是一个不同的故事）。 “Duh”是婴儿在世界各地发出的早期声音的典型代表。当他们大约六到八个月大时，婴儿开始唠叨，尝试使用辅音 - 元音组合，如“da da”，“bi bi”或“koy koy”。这种bab呀学语产生了大多数人发现的两个单词世界语言：<i>妈妈</ i>和<i>爸爸</ i>。 </ p><p>It is not surprising that <i>mama</i> is an intimate word for <i>mother </i>in both German and Urdu, since these are distantly related Indo-European languages. But variations of <i>mama</i> are found across the globe in completely unrelated languages, from Mandarin (<i>ma</i><i>–</i><i>ma</i>) in China to Igbo (<i>mama</i>) in Nigeria to Tamil (<i>amma</i>) in India. <i>Papa </i>varies a bit more: It’s <i>tatay</i> in Tagalog, <i>baba</i> in Persian, and <i>daa</i> in Chechen, for example. Linguist Roman Jakobson hypothesized that ma, closely followed by pa/da/ta/ba, are the easiest sounds for new human tongues to produce. Over and over, excited parents heard this “talking” and hopefully assumed that these sounds referred to them. Eventually the babbling was codified into words, and so wherever there are parents, there are children who refer to them with some form of <i>mama</i> and <i>papa</i>. </p><p> <i> mama </ i>对于德语和乌尔都语中的<i>母亲</ i>来说是一个亲密的词，这并不奇怪，因为它们与印欧语言有很大关系。但是<i>妈妈</ i>的变体在全球范围内以完全不相关的语言发现，来自普通话（<i> ma </ i> <i>  -  </ i> <i> ma </ i>）中国到尼日利亚的Igbo（<i> mama </ i>）到印度的泰米尔语（<i> amma </ i>）。 <p> Papa </ i>变化多一点：在菲律宾语中它是<i> tatay </ i>，在波斯语中是<i> baba </ i>，在车臣中是<i> daa </ i> 。语言学家罗曼·雅各布森（Roman Jakobson）假设马，紧跟pa / da / ta / ba，是新的人类语言产生的最简单的声音。一遍又一遍，兴奋的父母听到这种“说话”，并希望这些声音能够传达给他们。最终，这些bab呀学语被编成了文字，所以只要有父母，就会有孩子用某种形式的<i> mama </ i>和<i> papa </ i>来称呼他们。 </ p><p>Another of these baby sounds has been surprisingly productive of English words: “ba ba.” This combination gives us <i>babble</i> itself, the name for babies’ early linguistic experiments as well as for any foolish, incoherent, or especially voluble speech. <i>Babble </i>is thus an example of onomatopoeia, since its “sound suggests its sense,” as Merriam-Webster’s dictionary puts it. <i>Baby</i> too comes from the “ba ba” of infant vocalization. </p><p>这些婴儿声音中的另一个令人惊讶地产生了英语单词：“ba ba。”这种组合给了我们<bab> babble </ i>本身，婴儿早期语言实验的名称以及任何愚蠢的，语无伦次，或特别是言语不合时宜。因此，<i> Babble </ i>是拟声词的一个例子，因为它的“声音暗示了它的意义”，正如梅里亚姆 - 韦伯斯特的字典所说的那样。婴儿</ i>也来自婴儿发声的“ba ba”。 </ p><p>Baby babbling has also given rise to two quite negative words. The ancient Greeks famously considered anyone who did not speak Greek to be “uncivilized.” They mocked these people as <i>barbaroi</i> because they were thought to make incomprehensible noises – “ba ba” or “bar bar” – like babies rather than speaking a “real” language. </p>婴儿bab呀学语也引起了两个相当消极的词。古希腊人着名地认为任何不会说希腊语的人都是“不文明的”。他们嘲笑这些人是<i> barbaroi </ i>，因为他们被认为会发出难以理解的声音 - “ba ba”或“bar bar” - 就像婴儿而不是说“真正的”语言。 </ p><p>In English, <i>barbarian</i> now means more or less the same thing, referring to a savage, uncultured person. In the 13th century, the “ba ba” sound also produced the French word <i>babewene</i>, a foolish or stupid person. This became the English <i>baboon</i>, the common term for ground-dwelling monkeys with large canine teeth, of the genus <i>Papio</i>.</p><p>在英语中，<i>野蛮人</ i>现在或多或少都是一样的，指的是一个野蛮的，没有文化的人。在13世纪，“巴巴”的声音也产生了法语单词<i> babewene </ i>，一个愚蠢或愚蠢的人。这成为了英语<i> baboon </ i>，这是具有大型犬齿的地栖猴的常用术语，属于<i> Papio </ i>。</ p><p>One word that seems as if it must have a similar origin is <i>babel</i>, but this word for “a confusing hubbub or din” doesn’t actually derive from baby noises. Babel and its tower, though, is our topic for next week.</p><p>似乎它必须具有相似来源的一个词是<i> babel </ i>，但是这个词对于“令人困惑的喧哗或喧闹”实际上并非源自婴儿的噪音。然而，巴贝尔及其塔楼是我们下周的主题。</ p>','2018-10-28 16:51:55','N');
